## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

An episodic arc structured like a terrible work week.

*   **Act I — The First Day (Sessions 1–2):** The party goes through their infernal orientation, meets their demonic boss and rival interns, and is given their first impossible task: acquiring the soul of a farmer who has outsmarted every devil sent after him.
*   **Act II — Climbing the Ladder (Sessions 3–5):** The party takes on increasingly bizarre tasks, competing with other intern teams. They must organize the annual "Scream-Fest" morale event, deal with an infestation of celestial puppies in the breakroom, and file the correct paperwork (in triplicate) to summon a minor demon.
*   **Act III — The Performance Review (Sessions 6–8):** It's time for the quarterly performance review. The party must prepare a presentation showcasing their successes to the Arch-Duke of their department, all while sabotaging their rivals and surviving the machinations of their boss, who plans to take all the credit.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “Orientation and Other Horrors”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Comedy
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives in the cubicle-filled hellscape of the Department of Soul Acquisitions.
    *   They meet their boss, Barzibub, who tasks them with their first mission: collect the soul of "Ol' Man Hemlock," a farmer who has successfully contested his damnation for 70 years on legal technicalities.
    *   They meet the rival intern team, a group of sycophantic and treacherous imps.
**Escalation:** Ol' Man Hemlock is not just a farmer; he's a retired celestial lawyer with a divine-powered legal team.

### Sessions 2-3 — “The Morale Event”
*   **Focus:** Problem Solving / Social
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Barzibub puts the party in charge of organizing the annual office morale event, the "Scream-Fest."
    *   They must book a location (the Phlegethon lava fields are overbooked), hire catering (the soul-larva are undercooked), and secure a musical guest (a cacophonous noise-band of damned bards).
    *   The rival interns are simultaneously trying to ruin the event.
**Escalation:** A high-ranking Arch-Devil decides to attend at the last minute, raising the stakes for success from "promotion" to "not being demoted to a soul-larva."

### Sessions 4-5 — “A Plague of Puppies”
*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Farce
*   **Key Events:**
    *   A minor celestial gate opens in the office breakroom, leading to an infestation of adorable, holy-powered puppies.
    *   The puppies' aura of pure goodness is causing the office's evil magic to malfunction and is making the devils physically ill.
    *   The party must clear out the infestation without harming the puppies (as that would violate section 4, subsection B of their mortal-interaction clause).
**Escalation:** The puppies' owner, a powerful, and very angry, angel of the celestial court, arrives to find out what happened to her pets.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Barzibub, Middle Manager of the Damned** — *The Terrible Boss*
    *   **Role:** The party's direct supervisor, a stressed-out, coffee-addicted Chain Devil.
    *   **Personality:** A classic micro-manager. He is obsessed with metrics, buzzwords, and taking credit for his underlings' work. He is utterly terrified of his own boss.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He has been embezzling soul-shards from the department to fund his addiction to a black-market, mortal-made energy drink.

2.  **Sleezle and Gretch** — *The Rival Interns*
    *   **Role:** A duo of conniving imps who are the party's main rivals for the coveted promotion.
    *   **Personality:** Sycophantic to superiors, treacherous to everyone else. They communicate in whispers and evil giggles.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** They are actually a single, hive-mind entity that is terrible at pretending to be two separate beings, often finishing each other's sentences or forgetting which one is which.

3.  **Brenda from Accounting** — *The Office Oracle*
    *   **Role:** A surprisingly cheerful and helpful Gorgon who works in the accounting department. She is a source of office gossip, rumors, and useful information.
    *   **Personality:** Peppy, friendly, and loves to chat. She is utterly oblivious to the torment and evil around her, treating it all like a normal 9-to-5 job.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is not actually an employee. She wandered in from the elemental plane of earth centuries ago, and everyone has been too scared to ask her to leave. She has no contract and no official position.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Cubicle Farm of Despair:** An endless, grey landscape of cubicles where the party has their desks.
2.  **The Breakroom of Eternal Stale Coffee:** The office breakroom, complete with a malfunctioning coffee machine and a portal to a realm of celestial puppies.
3.  **The Great Archives:** A labyrinthine library of damned souls' contracts, where the paperwork is as dangerous as any monster.
4.  **The Boardroom of the Arch-Duke:** The intimidating, obsidian boardroom where the final presentation takes place.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a satirical take on corporate culture and the absurdity of bureaucracy. The central conflict is not about saving the world, but about surviving the workday. It pits the players against the mundane horrors of office life, amplified by the fact that their boss is a literal devil and failure could mean an eternity of torment (or worse, being forced to file paperwork forever).

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Performance Reviews & KPIs**
*   Instead of XP, the party gains **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for completing tasks, impressing superiors, or successfully sabotaging their rivals.
*   At the end of each major task, they have a **Performance Review** with Barzibub. Based on their KPIs, they can earn boons (like a temporary +1 weapon made of pure spite), promotions (access to restricted areas), or banes (being forced to use the cursed, perpetually-jammed printer).

### 2. **Infernal Paperwork**
*   Many tasks require filling out the correct infernal form. This is represented by a puzzle or a skill challenge.
*   For example, to summon a demon, the party might need to fill out Form 27B/6, which requires a successful DC 15 History check to recall the demon's true name, a DC 18 Sleight of Hand check to forge the correct signature, and a drop of blood (1d4 necrotic damage).
*   Failing the paperwork can lead to summoning the wrong creature, incurring a penalty, or simply having the request denied.
