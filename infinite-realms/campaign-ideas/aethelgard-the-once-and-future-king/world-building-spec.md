**Aethelgard: The Once and Future King**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the Aethelgard System, the Knights of the Round Table are noble pilots of magically-powered, colossal mechs called "Armigers." When High King Uther is assassinated by the usurper Lord Mordred, the system is thrown into civil war. The players, a new generation of knights and their retainers, are branded traitors and forced to flee. Guided by the god-like AI known as MERLIN, they must find Uther's hidden, illegitimate heir, Arthur, and help him claim his birthright by pulling the command sword *Excalibur* from the system's ultimate weapon: a planet-destroying space fortress named Camelot.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully recruit the Miner's Guild to their cause.
    *   **THEN:** The rebel fleet gains access to superior fuel and resources. Mordred's fleet suffers supply shortages. Generate a mission where the players must protect a Guild convoy from Mordred's forces.
    *   **IF:** The players fail to retrieve the crystal for the Lady of the Lake.
    *   **THEN:** The Lady of the Lake refuses to help them find Arthur. The players must find another way to locate him, perhaps by capturing and interrogating one of Mordred's elite knights.
    *   **IF:** Arthur hesitates during a critical battle due to his self-doubt.
    *   **THEN:** A key rebel ally is killed or a major objective is lost. Generate a narrative path for the players to help Arthur overcome his doubt or for another NPC to challenge his leadership.
    *   **IF:** The players manage to defeat Mordred's champion before the final assault on Camelot.
    *   **THEN:** Mordred's forces suffer a massive morale penalty. Mordred becomes more reckless and desperate, potentially unleashing a forbidden weapon provided by Morgana.
    *   **IF:** The players present irrefutable proof of Mordred's pact with the alien Morgana to the system.
    *   **THEN:** Some of Mordred's own forces defect, creating a civil war within the civil war. Generate a scenario where the players must aid these defectors.
