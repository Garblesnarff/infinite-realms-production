## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A retelling of Arthurian legend with giant robots.

*   **Act I — The Spark of Rebellion (Sessions 1–5):** The players witness the assassination of King Uther by the usurper, Lord Mordred.

They will dogfight with Mordred's knights in asteroid fields, seek guidance from a mysterious cyber-oracle on a forest moon, and upgrade their Armigers with lost technology scavenged from ancient battlefields.

They must break through Mordred's blockade, defeat his champion in a climactic Armiger duel, and help Arthur pull *Excalibur* to unite the system against a greater, alien threat manipulated by a shadowy figure named Morgana.

    *   The party meets MERLIN, a vast, ancient AI who was the King's secret advisor.

    *   The party must travel to Lyonesse and navigate the politics of the powerful Miner's Guild to find information on Arthur's whereabouts.

## Major NPCs

1.  **MERLIN** — *The AI Oracle*
    *   **Role:** The Mainframe Emergency Response & Logistical Intelligence Network. An ancient, god-like AI who runs the Aethelgard system's core infrastructure. It is the party's guide and benefactor.
    *   **Personality:** Omniscient, patient, and speaks in calm, logical, but often cryptic, pronouncements. It sees time and events as lines of code that can be edited.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** MERLIN orchestrated the original plan for Uther to hide Arthur away. It sees the current crisis as a regrettable but necessary step in a centuries-long plan to prepare the system for a future threat it will not elaborate on.

2.  **Arthur** — *The Reluctant Heir*
    *   **Role:** A young, naturally gifted pilot from a backwater planet, with no knowledge of his royal blood.
    *   **Personality:** Idealistic, brave, and a bit naive. He is a brilliant pilot but is overwhelmed by the weight of the destiny thrust upon him. He is unsure if he wants to be a king.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is plagued by self-doubt. He fears he is not as good as the legend MERLIN is building around him, and this insecurity can cause him to hesitate at critical moments.

3.  **Lord Mordred** — *The Usurper*
    *   **Role:** The ambitious and ruthless leader of the coup. He was once Uther's most trusted general.
    *   **Personality:** A firm believer in order through strength. He sees Uther's rule as weak and decadent and believes his own iron-fisted control is the only way to keep the system safe. He is not cartoonishly evil, but a patriot with a dark methodology.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is being manipulated by Morgana, a mysterious, alien entity who has promised him the power to repel the extra-galactic threat that MERLIN is preparing for, but at a terrible cost.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a futuristic, high-action retelling of Arthurian myth, exploring themes of destiny, choice, and the burden of legends. The central conflict is a civil war that pits two opposing philosophies of leadership against each other: Arthur's idealism versus Mordred's pragmatism. The players are the fulcrum, and their actions will determine whether the system is saved through hope or through control.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Armiger Combat**
*   When piloting their mechs, players use a supplementary **Armiger Sheet**. The Armiger has its own Hull Points, AC, and a resource called **System Strain**.
*   Using powerful weapons or maneuvers (like a dodge-boost) builds up Strain. If Strain exceeds a threshold, the Armiger's systems may overload, causing weapons to jam, shields to fail, or even a temporary shutdown.
*   Between missions, players can use salvaged parts to customize their Armigers, installing new weapons (arc-lances, plasma cannons), defensive systems (shield generators, flare launchers), or arcane engines that allow them to cast spells through the Armiger.

### 2. **The Round Table Council**
*   As the party's reputation grows, they will attract NPC knights, engineers, and spies to their cause. These allies form a new **Round Table Council**.
*   Before a major mission, the players can assign their council members to **Support Operations**. *Example: "Send Sir Galahad and the Stealth-Wing to raid Mordred's supply lines." "Have our chief engineer attempt to hack the enemy's communications before the battle."
*   These operations are resolved with a simple d20 roll plus a relevant modifier. Success grants the party a tangible advantage in their upcoming mission, such as weakened enemy forces, detailed enemy schematics, or a powerful, single-use support ability.
