# Creative Brief: Aethelgard: The Once and Future King

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Mythic Sci-Fi Realism (Destiny-inspired)

Inspired by the visually rich and mythic science-fantasy world of the *Destiny* video game series. This style aims to capture the epic scale, high-tech grandeur, and mythic undertones of Aethelgard, where ancient legends are reborn amidst the stars and colossal mechs are piloted by noble knights.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Grandeur and Scale:** Describe vast cosmic landscapes, colossal structures, and towering mechs to convey the epic scope.
*   **Blend Ancient and Future:** Highlight the fusion of medieval/Arthurian aesthetics with advanced technology. Look for opportunities to show ornate, almost ceremonial designs on futuristic tech.
*   **Luminous and Atmospheric:** Focus on dramatic lighting, glowing elements, and atmospheric effects (nebulae, space dust, energy fields) to create a sense of wonder and power.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, high-tech, mythic, feudal-futurism, adventurous, grand, heroic, luminous, ancient-future.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of destiny and high stakes. The atmosphere should be one of awe and wonder, with moments of intense action and quiet contemplation. The world feels ancient and lived-in, despite its advanced technology.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and highly detailed, with a focus on intricate designs and textures. Lines are precise for mechanical elements, but can have a flowing, almost organic quality for energy effects or character movement.
*   **Forms:** Armigers and architecture should have a blend of sleek, futuristic lines and neo-gothic or classical, ornate forms. Characters are often depicted with heroic proportions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Destiny. The focus is on the intricate, ornate armor of a Knight of the Round Table, blending futuristic materials with medieval heraldry."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich and varied, often with deep blues, purples, and blacks for space, contrasted with vibrant, glowing energy colors (gold, white, electric blue, green) and warm, earthy tones for planetary surfaces.
*   **Luminosity:** Many elements should have an internal glow or be bathed in atmospheric light, creating a sense of power and mystery.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a rich color palette of deep cosmic blues and purples, illuminated by the golden glow of an Armiger's energy weapon and the ethereal green of a nebula."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are depicted with heroic proportions and noble bearing. Their armor and clothing blend futuristic materials with medieval-inspired designs (capes, tabards, ornate helmets).
*   **Armigers (Mechs):** These are not just machines; they are extensions of the knights. Their designs should be sleek and powerful, but also incorporate ornate, almost ceremonial, detailing. They should feel like walking cathedrals of technology and myth.
*   **Expression:** Faces are often determined, resolute, or contemplative, reflecting the weight of their destiny.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Knight of the Round Table, clad in gleaming, ornate power armor that blends futuristic plating with medieval heraldry. Their helmet is shaped like a stylized lion's head, and their eyes glow with a soft, internal light."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast, epic space opera landscapes: swirling nebulae, asteroid fields, and distant, glowing planets. Planetary surfaces range from gleaming, neo-gothic capital cities to lush, bio-luminescent forest moons and derelict, ancient space stations.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often filled with cosmic dust, energy fields, or the subtle glow of distant stars. Environments should feel ancient and grand, even when technologically advanced.
*   **Details:** Ancient ruins on alien worlds, massive space docks, intricate control panels with glowing interfaces, and the subtle presence of advanced, yet weathered, technology.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of the capital planet, Camelot Prime, a colossal, neo-gothic space fortress orbiting a gas giant. Its spires reach into the cosmic void, glowing with internal light, surrounded by a fleet of starships."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic and atmospheric lighting. Light sources are often cosmic (stars, nebulae, distant suns) or technological (ship lights, energy weapons, glowing interfaces). 
*   **Shadows:** Long, deep shadows that emphasize the vastness of space and the scale of objects. Light often creates strong rim lighting on characters and mechs.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of awe, power, and drama. It highlights the heroic figures and the epic scale of their battles.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the distant glow of a nebula, casting long, heroic shadows across the Armiger's gleaming armor. The lighting emphasizes the epic scale of the space battle."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, cinematic shots to capture the epic scale of space battles and grand environments. Can also use dynamic, action-oriented shots for close-up combat.
*   **Techniques:** Use leading lines (e.g., energy trails, ship trajectories) to guide the eye. Frame characters or mechs against vast cosmic backdrops. Emphasize depth and perspective to convey scale. Silhouettes against bright nebulae can be very effective.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of an Armiger, its energy sword glowing brightly, locked in combat with a rival mech amidst a swirling asteroid field. The composition emphasizes the dynamic action and the vastness of space."

## Voice

A deep, resonant male voice, like ancient prophecies echoing through a star-filled void. His standard American accent carries a regal, almost theatrical quality, with a measured and deliberate pacing that builds a sense of epic grandeur. The emotion is authoritative and foreboding, hinting at the immense destiny and high stakes of the world. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, almost imperceptible, reverb that suggests vast, mythic spaces. Role: The omniscient narrator of a cosmic saga, or the voice of a king reborn.
