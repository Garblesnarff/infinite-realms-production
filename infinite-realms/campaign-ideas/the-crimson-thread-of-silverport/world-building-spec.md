### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

*   **Content:** This campaign chronicles the history of the city of Silverport through the eyes of three successive generations of heroes. The players will create a founding family or group, and their actions, rivalries, and unfinished business will directly shape the world for their children and grandchildren (their future characters). A mysterious symbol, the Crimson Thread, weaves through the city's history, hinting at a deep-rooted conspiracy that only a lasting legacy can unravel.

    *   **IF:** At the end of Act 1, the players chose to make a deal with the Iron Crows.
    *   **THEN:** In Act 2, their descendants start with more wealth and criminal contacts, but have a negative reputation with the city guard and the nobility.
    *   **IF:** A player in Gen 1 completes the "Unfinished Business" of finding the treasure of Captain Fairwind.
    *   **THEN:** Their Gen 2 character inherits the treasure, but also the enmity of the captain's surviving crew.
    *   **IF:** The players in Gen 2 discover Lady Vane's secret pact.

    *   **IF:** The players in any generation ignore the Crimson Thread conspiracy to focus on personal wealth.
    *   **THEN:** In the next generation, the conspiracy is more powerful and deeply embedded in the city's infrastructure, making the final act significantly more difficult.
