## Story Arc (Epic Campaign — 20+ sessions)

A story told over sixty years of city history.

*   **Act I — The Founding (Levels 1–7):** The players create their first characters in the early, rough-and-tumble days of Silverport. They might be ambitious merchants, city guards fighting corruption, or mages establishing a new guild. Their story will set the stage, creating the core relationships and conflicts that will define the city for decades.
*   **Act II — The Inheritance (Levels 5–13):** Twenty years later, the city has grown, and so have the consequences of Act I. The players create new characters who are the children, proteges, or inheritors of their original heroes. They must navigate the political and social landscape their predecessors built, facing old grudges, magical debts, and a new manifestation of the Crimson Thread conspiracy.
*   **Act III — The Legacy (Levels 12–20):** Another twenty years pass. Silverport is now a major world power. The players take on their final characters, who stand at the pinnacle of the legacies their families have built. The Crimson Thread conspiracy finally reveals its endgame, a threat to the entire city, and the players must use the combined wealth, knowledge, and power of their lineage to save Silverport once and for all.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about the nature of legacy and the idea that history is not just something that happens, but something that is built, for good or ill. The central conflict is a slow-burning conspiracy that is too big for any one hero to solve. It requires the players to think not just about their current characters, but about the future they are building for their descendants, forcing them to make choices that will echo for generations.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Legacy System**
*   At the end of each Act (generation), the DM works with the players to define the **Legacies** their characters left behind. These become tangible mechanics for the next generation.
*   **Family Legacy (Boon):** *"The Thorne family built the city's Great Bridge."* → All Thorne characters in the next generation start with a +2 bonus to social checks with government officials and a small, passive income.
*   **Rivalry Legacy (Bane):** *"The Blackwood family destroyed the Iron Crow syndicate."* → The new Iron Crows will actively target any Blackwood character, and they have disadvantage on social checks in criminal circles.
*   **Unfinished Business (Quest Hook):** *"The first hero died searching for the lost treasure of Captain Fairwind."* → Their descendant finds their old, incomplete treasure map, providing a personal quest hook for the next Act.

### 2. **Generational Downtime**
*   The 20-year time-skip between Acts is a playable downtime phase. Each player makes a series of narrative choices for their character's life.
*   *Examples: "I focus on building my family's wealth," "I seek political office," "I secretly investigate the Crimson Thread," "I retire to a quiet life, but train my child in the ways of the sword."
*   The outcomes of these choices, determined by a few simple rolls, directly influence the starting resources, contacts, and personal quests of their next character, making the time-skip a meaningful part of the story.
