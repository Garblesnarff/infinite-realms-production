# Creative Brief: Star-Eater's Wake

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Industrial Sci-Fi Horror

Inspired by the claustrophobic, high-tension, and biomechanical horror of films like *Alien* and games like *Dead Space*. This style grounds its horror in a tangible, gritty, industrial reality. The aesthetic is dark, oppressive, and focuses on the terrifying fusion of organic/crystalline life with cold, hard technology.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Claustrophobia:** Use descriptions that create a sense of confinement. "Narrow corridors," "low ceilings," "cramped maintenance tunnels," "vents choked with crystalline growth."
*   **Light is a Resource:** Treat light as a key element of survival and horror. Describe the darkness and the limited, often unreliable, light sources.
*   **Juxtapose Man-Made and Alien:** The horror comes from the corruption of the familiar. Contrast the straight, functional lines of the ship with the sharp, unnatural, and invasive angles of the crystalline entity.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Claustrophobic, tense, industrial, gritty, biomechanical, cosmic horror, survival.
*   **Feeling:** A constant state of dread and oppressive tension. The environment itself is the primary antagonist. The feeling of being trapped, isolated, and hunted in a cold, metal tomb.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Highly realistic and detailed, with a focus on texture and grit. This is a photorealistic style meant to feel visceral and real.
*   **Forms:** The ship is built from hard, functional, geometric shapes (pipes, bulkheads, grates). The entity is composed of sharp, asymmetrical, crystalline structures that grow in, on, and through the ship's technology in a parasitic, cancerous way.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic, gritty, and detailed digital painting. The focus is on the contrast between the cold, rusted metal of the corridor and the sharp, glowing crystalline shards bursting through the walls."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Extremely desaturated and dark. The palette is dominated by industrial tones: deep grays, rusted browns, oily blacks, and cold metallic blues.
*   **Accent Colors:** Light is the primary accent. The cold, sterile white of emergency lighting, the red of warning strobes, the blue of a plasma cutter, and the unsettling, internal bioluminescent glow of the crystalline entity (perhaps a sickly purple or green).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark and desaturated industrial color palette, broken only by the harsh red glare of an emergency alarm light and the faint, sickly green bioluminescence of the alien crystal."

**4. Character & Creature Design:**
*   **Characters:** The player characters should look like blue-collar workers, not soldiers. They wear practical, bulky, and worn-down salvage gear or space suits. Their faces should be expressive of fear, exhaustion, and grim determination.
*   **Creatures ("Antibodies"):** These are the core of the horror. They are biomechanical and crystalline. Imagine creatures made of sharpened, crystal-like bone fused with torn cables and metal plating from the ship. They are asymmetrical, fast, and predatory. Body horror is essential.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A terrified salvage crew member in a bulky, stained spacesuit, armed with a plasma cutter. A crystalline monster, a horrifying fusion of sharp, translucent shards and twisted ship components, scuttles on the ceiling."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The ship, the *Genesis*, is a character. It's a vast, industrial generation ship, now a tomb. Environments are cramped, functional, and now corrupted.
*   **Details:** Exposed wiring, sparking conduits, steam venting from pipes, emergency shutters half-closed. Crystalline growths should appear like cancerous tumors or sharp-edged fungi, breaking through metal and glass.
*   **Key Locations:** The bridge should be a cathedral of dead screens and crystal thrones. The hydroponics bay is a jungle of alien crystal flora. The engineering core is a pulsating, cavernous heart of the entity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The scene is a cramped, narrow maintenance corridor. Pipes line the walls, dripping with condensation. The floor is a metal grate, and from below, a sickly purple light glows, revealing crystalline tendrils wrapped around the conduits."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High-contrast and diegetic. Light should only come from sources that exist in the scene (helmet lights, flickering overheads, tool sparks, the entity's glow). This creates pools of light in vast oceans of oppressive darkness.
*   **Shadows:** Shadows are deep, black, and absolute. They are used to hide threats and create jump scares. What you can't see is more terrifying than what you can.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit only by the narrow beam of a helmet-mounted flashlight, creating sharp, high-contrast shadows. The darkness outside the beam is absolute and impenetrable."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Claustrophobic and personal. Use tight, over-the-shoulder shots, or first-person perspectives to put the viewer in the characters' shoes.
*   **Techniques:** Frame shots with doorways, pipes, or debris to enhance the feeling of being trapped. Use low or high angles to make the environment feel disorienting and threatening.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tight, claustrophobic shot looking over the character's shoulder, down a long, dark corridor. A monstrous silhouette is barely visible in the far distance."

## Voice

A cold, ageless, female voice, smooth and synthesized, like a malfunctioning ship AI calmly reporting on a catastrophic event. Her neutral, almost robotic, standard American accent carries a measured and unnervingly calm pacing, even when describing horrific events. The emotion is a complete lack of human feeling, replaced by a sense of detached efficiency and the chilling indifference of a machine. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, high-frequency hum and occasional static crackles, as if from a ship's internal comms system, emphasizing the isolation and dread. Role: The voice of the *Genesis* itself, or a corrupted AI overseeing the demise of its crew.
