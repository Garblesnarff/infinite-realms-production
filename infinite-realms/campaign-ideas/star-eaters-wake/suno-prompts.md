### **1. The Genesis - General Ambience**

*   **Song Title:** "The Silent Starship"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A dark and oppressive industrial ambient track. A deep, low-frequency hum, like the sound of a massive, dormant engine, is layered with the faint, rhythmic creak of stressed metal and the cold, sterile hiss of a failing life support system. A sense of immense, empty space and profound isolation pervades the track, creating a feeling of being trapped in a cold, metal tomb.`

### **2. The Crystalline Growth**

*   **Song Title:** "The Cancer of the Stars"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A strange and unsettling soundscape. A high-pitched, crystalline ringing, like the sound of a wine glass being rubbed, is layered with a wet, squelching sound, as if the crystals are growing through living tissue. A subtle, low-frequency pulse, like a slow, alien heartbeat, underpins the track, creating a sense of a parasitic, unnatural life form.`

### **3. The Antibodies**

*   **Song Title:** "The Ship's Immune Response"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A tense and chaotic action track. A driving, industrial rhythm, made of distorted, metallic percussion and the screech of tearing metal, is layered with the high-pitched, chittering sounds of crystalline creatures. The music is fast, aggressive, and relentless, creating a sense of being hunted by a swarm of biomechanical horrors.`

### **4. The Hunter**

*   **Song Title:** "The Thing in the Vents"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A terrifying and suspenseful track. The track is mostly silent, punctuated only by the sound of a single, heavy creature moving through a metal vent. The sound is a mix of sharp, crystalline clicks and the slow, deliberate scrape of metal on metal. The sound should pan from left to right, creating a sense of being stalked by an unseen, intelligent predator.`

### **5. The Echo of the Captain**

*   **Song Title:** "The Captain's Lie"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A deceptive and unsettling ambient piece. A calm, reassuring, and slightly distorted human voice speaks in a loop, offering words of comfort and guidance. The voice is layered with a high-pitched, almost inaudible, crystalline ringing that slowly grows in intensity, creating a sense of a beautiful lie hiding a terrifying truth.`

### **6. The Hydroponics Bay**

*   **Song Title:** "The Crystal Garden"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A beautiful and deadly ambient track. The sound of a gentle, trickling waterfall is layered with the soft, shimmering chime of crystalline plants. A slow, enchanting melody, played on a glass harmonica, creates a sense of a beautiful, alien jungle. However, a subtle, underlying dissonance hints at the predatory nature of this crystalline flora.`

### **7. The Crystalline Heart**

*   **Song Title:** "The Star-Eater's Heart"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A massive and overwhelming industrial-choral track. A deep, powerful, and rhythmic pulse, like a colossal heartbeat, is the foundation of the track. This is layered with a full, screaming choir, singing a single, dissonant note, and the sound of a thousand grinding, crystalline gears. The music should be a wall of sound, creating a sense of being in the presence of a vast, god-like, and utterly alien intelligence.`

### **8. The Escape**

*   **Song Title:** "The Wake of the Genesis"
*   **Suno Prompt:** `A frantic and epic action track. A driving, high-tempo electronic beat is layered with a full orchestra, playing a heroic and desperate melody. The sound of explosions, tearing metal, and the roar of a starship engine create a sense of a high-octane, cinematic escape from a collapsing, world-sized monster.`
