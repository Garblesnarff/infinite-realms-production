---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Star-Eater's Wake
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Sci-Fi Horror / Survival / Dungeon Crawl
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **12–13**
**Tone (keywords):** tense, claustrophobic, cosmic horror, isolated, survival
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are a hard-luck salvage crew in a future where technology and magic have intertwined. They hit the jackpot: a distress signal from the *Genesis*, a legendary generation ship that vanished a century ago. Boarding the colossal, silent vessel, they find it not dead, but transformed. A parasitic, crystalline entity from beyond the stars has consumed the ship, turning it into a living, predatory ecosystem that now sees the crew as a fresh source of nutrients.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A desperate escape from a living, breathing starship dungeon.

*   **Act I — The Ghost Ship (Sessions 1–2):** The party docks with and boards the *Genesis*. They explore the silent, darkened crew and command decks, finding strange crystalline growths and evidence of a struggle, before realizing they are trapped.
*   **Act II — The Hunting Ground (Sessions 3–6):** The ship awakens. The entity, sensing the new intruders, begins actively hunting them. Corridors twist and reshape, gravity fluctuates, and crystalline "antibodies" spawn to attack the party as they fight their way towards the engineering core to sever the docking clamp.
*   **Act III — The Star-Eater's Heart (Sessions 7–10):** The party reaches the engineering core, now a pulsating, crystalline heart of the entity. They must plant a makeshift bomb to trigger a self-destruct, then survive a frantic, high-octane chase back to their ship as the entire *Genesis* collapses around them.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Signal”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Atmosphere / Tension
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party's ship, the *Stray Comet*, picks up the legendary distress call.
    *   They board the *Genesis*, finding it dark, cold, and eerily silent. The only light comes from strange, glowing crystals.
    *   They discover the docking clamp is fused shut, and the ship's power is offline.
**Escalation:** The airlock door slams shut behind them, and the ship's internal lights flicker on, revealing the crystalline growth is far more extensive than they realized. They are not alone.

### Sessions 2-4 — “Antibodies”
*   **Focus:** Survival / Combat
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The ship's immune system begins to react. The first wave of crystalline monsters (the "Antibodies") attacks.
    *   The party must navigate the shifting, treacherous environment of the ship's interior, which now actively works against them (doors sealing, gravity plating failing).
    *   They find logs from the original crew, detailing their horrific last days and their failed attempt to fight the entity.
**Escalation:** A massive, intelligent "Hunter" antibody, a creature specifically adapted to hunt sentient life, begins stalking the party through the ship's vents.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Echo of the Captain”
*   **Focus:** Psychological Horror / Deception
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The entity begins to psychically attack the party, creating vivid hallucinations of their pasts or offering them deals for their survival.
    *   It manifests an "Echo" of the *Genesis*'s original captain, a friendly, reassuring figure who tries to lead them into traps.
    *   The party encounters the Last Survivor, a crazed crewmember who has been living in the walls for decades and is hostile to the party.
**Escalation:** The Echo of the Captain offers to lead them to a (non-existent) escape pod, a path that leads directly to the entity's primary feeding ground.

## Major NPCs

1.  **AURA (Automated Unified Response AI)** — *The Fragmented Guide*
    *   **Role:** The *Genesis*'s original AI, now shattered and corrupted by the entity.
    *   **Personality:** Communicates through flickering screens, distorted audio, and malfunctioning service drones. It speaks in broken, looping phrases, but is trying to help the party, seeing them as its last chance to fulfill its duty to protect life.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Parts of its code have been co-opted by the entity. Sometimes, its advice is not its own, but a lure from the Star-Eater.

2.  **The Last Survivor (Dr. Aris Thorne)** — *The Crazed Hermit*
    *   **Role:** A former xenobotanist from the original crew who has survived by hiding and performing horrific cybernetic self-modifications.
    *   **Personality:** Paranoid, feral, and speaks in a language of clicks and whispers. He sees the party not as rescuers, but as a new source of spare parts and a threat to his territory.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He carries a data-drive containing the entity's only known weakness, but he is terrified of the entity and will not give up the drive easily.

3.  **The Star-Eater's Echo** — *The Psychic Predator*
    *   **Role:** A psychic manifestation of the entity's intelligence, usually appearing as the ship's noble, heroic captain.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, charismatic, and deeply manipulative. It preys on hope, offering plausible-sounding advice and false promises to lead the party to their doom.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** It is not a true consciousness, but a complex mimic. It cannot understand concepts like self-sacrifice or altruism, a fact the party can exploit to unmask it.

## Key Locations

1.  **The *Stray Comet*:** The party's small, cramped salvage ship. Their only hope of escape.
2.  **The Bridge of the *Genesis*:** The command center, now a throne room of crystal where the Echo of the Captain often appears.
3.  **The Hydroponics Bay:** A former lush garden, now a terrifying jungle of crystalline flora and predatory plant-monsters.
4.  **The Crystalline Heart:** The ship's engineering core, now a pulsating, city-sized geode that serves as the entity's brain and heart.

## Central Conflict

This is a story of pure survival against a truly alien foe. The central conflict is not about good vs. evil, but about life vs. consumption. It pits the party's ingenuity and resilience against a living dungeon that is actively trying to absorb them, testing their ability to work together under extreme, claustrophobic pressure.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Ship's Immune System**
*   The DM tracks a **Threat Meter** from 1 to 10. The meter increases whenever the party makes significant noise (using explosives), draws a large amount of power, or damages a key part of the ship.
*   At different thresholds, the ship reacts:
    *   **Threat 1-3:** Basic antibodies (small crystalline scuttlers) spawn from the walls.
    *   **Threat 4-6:** The environment becomes hostile. Doors may lock, gravity may shift, or a hallucinatory fog may fill the halls.
    *   **Threat 7-9:** Advanced antibodies (Hunters, Stalkers) are created specifically to counter the party's tactics.
    *   **Threat 10:** The Entity's core consciousness focuses on the party, sending a massive wave of monsters and directly attacking their minds.
*   The Threat Meter decreases slowly over time if the party remains hidden and quiet.

### 2. **Salvage & Adaptation**
*   The party can spend 10 minutes and make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Tinker's Tools check to **Salvage** a piece of the ship's technology.
*   The DC depends on the complexity of the desired component. Success yields a useful item, while failure might increase the Threat Meter.
*   *Examples: Salvaging a power conduit to create a makeshift shock trap. Ripping out a computer terminal to get a map of the current deck. Using scrap metal to reinforce a door.* This encourages creative, risky, and resource-draining problem-solving.
