# The Mourning Fields of Kyshtym

## Real-World Basis: The Kyshtym Disaster
In 1957, a plutonium storage tank at the Mayak nuclear plant in the Soviet Union exploded, releasing a massive plume of radioactive contamination. The disaster, kept secret for decades, was one of the worst nuclear incidents in history, creating a vast, uninhabitable exclusion zone and causing widespread health issues.

## D&D Twist
A secretive magocracy of wizards, attempting to achieve godhood, was experimenting with tapping directly into the Weave for raw, unlimited power. Their central arcane reactor, a device designed to hold and refine pure magic, went critical. The resulting explosion was a silent, violet blast that didn't level the city but saturated the entire province with raw, untamed magic. This area is now known as the "Mourning Fields," a land where the laws of nature and magic are broken.

## Campaign Premise (Magical Post-Apocalypse/Survival)
Decades after the "Silent Blast," the Mourning Fields are a magically-irradiated wasteland. The very landscape is mutated—rivers of liquid magic flow through crystalline forests, and the ground is covered in twitching, magical flora. All magic cast within the zone has a high chance of triggering wild, unpredictable surges. The players are hired by an outside power—a desperate king, a wealthy patron, a high-ranking cleric—to enter the Mourning Fields. Their mission is to retrieve a vital artifact from the ruins of the magocracy's central tower or to rescue a famous scholar who vanished while studying the zone. They must navigate the treacherous, mutated landscape, battle spell-warped monstrosities, and contend with the twisted descendants of the disaster's survivors—insane cults who worship the "Violet Fire" and mutated beings who have adapted to the Mourning in strange and terrifying ways.

## Key Elements
*   **A Wild Magic Zone:** The entire campaign setting is a permanent Wild Magic zone. Every spell cast is a gamble, leading to chaotic, dangerous, and often hilarious results. This forces players, especially magic-users, to think creatively and weigh the risks of using their powers.
*   **Mutated Bestiary:** The monsters are familiar D&D creatures, but twisted by the magical radiation. An Owlbear might have three heads and a breath weapon. A Displacer Beast might not just displace its image, but also displace the space around it. This allows for unique and unpredictable combat encounters.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** The danger is not just from monsters. Players will have to cross rivers of raw magic, seek shelter from "mana storms," and avoid areas of high magical contamination that could lead to forced mutations (either temporary or permanent).
*   **The Ruined City:** At the heart of the Mourning Fields is the magocracy's ruined city, a D&D version of Chernobyl's Pripyat. It is a ghost city of silent towers, magical automatons still performing their programmed tasks, and powerful, unique undead created from the wizards who were at the epicenter of the blast.

## Tone
*S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl* meets D&D's Wild Magic. A game of survival, exploration, and body horror in a beautiful but utterly lethal, magically-mutated wasteland.
