## Voice

A distorted, gender-neutral voice, crackling and fragmented, like a corrupted radio transmission struggling through a mana storm. The timbre is gravelly and carries a subtle, unsettling hum, as if the very air is vibrating with chaotic magic. The pacing is erratic and unpredictable, with sudden bursts of static and elongated, drawn-out words, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the wasteland. The emotion is a blend of detached observation, a subtle, underlying madness, and the chilling indifference of a world consumed by chaotic magic. Audio quality is heavily distorted and lo-fi, with constant static, digital artifacts, and the faint, ambient sound of crackling energy and distant, mutated roars. Role: The voice of the corrupted land itself, or a survivor whose mind has been warped by the magical radiation.
