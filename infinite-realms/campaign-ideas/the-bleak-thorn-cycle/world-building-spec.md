### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Bleak Thorn Cycle**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** An ancient hedge of black brambles, the Bleak Thorn, encroaches upon the borderlands, spreading a supernatural plague of memory loss and twisting nature into monstrous forms. The players, touched by this creeping dread, discover the hedge grows from the wound of a sleeping god. They must navigate the plots of a strange cult and the desperation of the locals to decide whether to heal the wound, destroy the thorn, or harness its power, knowing each choice has a terrible cost.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of the sleeping nature-god and the ancient events that led to its wounding and binding.
    *   Write the founding dogma of the Cult of the Slow Sap. Why do they believe the thorn is a holy thing?
    *   Describe the magical nature of the Bleak Thorn's memory-draining properties.
    *   Explain the story of the last person to try and stop the thorn and how they failed.
    *   Detail the folklore and superstitions the locals have about the Bleak Thorn and the creatures within it.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Villagers of Harrowfield** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To survive and push back the Bleak Thorn.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Loosely led by the pragmatic village elder, Matron Halan.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To protect their homes and families.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Matron Halan secretly made a bargain with the thorn decades ago to save the village from a famine, a guilt she carries.
        *   **Assets:** A small militia, deep knowledge of the local lands (as they used to be), a strong sense of community.
        *   **Relationships:** Distrustful of the cult; desperate for the players' help.
    *   **The Cult of the Slow Sap** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To tend to the Bleak Thorn and spread its influence, which they see as a form of remembrance.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Matriarch of Slow Sap, with outpost leaders like Lysandre Vael.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To live in harmony with the "natural" cycle of the thorn.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To become one with the thorn, achieving a form of hive-mind immortality by sacrificing their individuality.
        *   **Assets:** Thorn-warped beasts, knowledge of thorn magic, hidden outposts within the hedge.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonists, who see the players as meddlers disrupting a holy process.
    *   **The Circle of Whispers** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To study and contain the thorn's supernatural properties without destroying it.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A small, secretive group of druids and scholars, including the wounded druid Eirlys.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To understand the blight.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Eirlys feels responsible for the thorn's creation and seeks a way to seal it without harming the sleeping god, a method that may be slower and more dangerous for the locals.
        *   **Assets:** Ancient rites and knowledge, hidden groves untouched by the thorn, the ability to communicate with nature spirits.
        *   **Relationships:** Wary of both the cult and the villagers' destructive impulses.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Eirlys Thorne:** A world-weary and guilt-ridden druid who knows the thorn's true origin.
    *   **Lysandre Vael:** A charismatic and philosophical cult leader who genuinely believes the thorn offers a path to peace.
    *   **Matron Halan:** The iron-willed and pragmatic elder of Harrowfield, haunted by a past decision.
    *   **The Matriarch of Slow Sap (Ilya the Bender):** The final antagonist, a calm and patient leader with a monstrous devotion to the thorn.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Memory-faded Villager"
    *   "Fanatical Thorn Cultist"
    *   "Thorn-Warped Wolf (Creature)"
    *   "Animated Thorn-Bramble (Creature)"
    *   "Opportunistic Treasure Hunter"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Marsh of Hollowmist:** Misty wetlands where time blurs and the thorn's influence is strong.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** Ancient standing stones, a druid's abandoned hut, a field of memory-draining flowers, the Great Willow.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Thorn-tendriled oozes, will-o'-wisps (memory sparks), territorial bog monsters.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Rare alchemical ingredients, cryptic clues from nature spirits.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A thick pollen fog causes hallucinations, the party stumbles upon a half-assimilated animal, a memory spark shows a vision of the past, a group of cultists are performing a ritual, the ground gives way to a sinkhole.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The druid Eirlys was last seen near the standing stones." "The Great Willow can answer a single question, for a price." "The cultists are harvesting the pollen for a ritual."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Thick fog, twisted trees, sickly sweet flowers, shimmering pollen), Sound (The buzz of insects, the squelch of mud, whispers on the wind), Smell (Damp earth, decay, sweet, cloying pollen).
    *   **The Wound (under Bone Hill):** The subterranean crypt where the sleeping god's petrified heart lies.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The antechamber with faded murals, the hall of skeletal guardians, the central shrine with the petrified heart, the root-chamber where the main thorn grows.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Skeletal guardians, thorn-spawned blights, the psychic echo of the sleeping god.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This is the final dungeon.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A psychic wave of sorrow emanates from the heart, a section of the crypt collapses, the party is tempted with whispers promising to restore lost memories, a powerful thorn-wraith attacks, the cult's Matriarch appears to parley.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The heart is not dead, only sleeping." "The ritual to seal the wound requires a willing sacrifice." "The cult believes the heart is a doorway to their god."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Dark, cramped tunnels; glowing, pulsating thorns; ancient carvings), Sound (A low, rhythmic hum; the scraping of bone; a faint, sorrowful melody), Smell (Dust, ozone, a metallic tang like old blood).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player fails a Memory Check when exposed to strong thorn magic.
    *   **THEN:** The player temporarily forgets a prepared spell, a language, or a key piece of information relevant to the current quest, forcing the party to adapt.
    *   **IF:** The players gain a point on the Corruption Track.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a short, unsettling nightmare for one of the players during their next long rest, revealing a cryptic clue but also increasing their paranoia.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully negotiate with Lysandre Vael instead of fighting him.
    *   **THEN:** He reveals a peaceful, but morally questionable, way to interact with the thorn. This puts the party at odds with Matron Halan and the villagers of Harrowfield.
    *   **IF:** The players fail to defend Harrowfield from the cultist assault.
    *   **THEN:** The village is partially assimilated by the thorn. The surviving villagers become desperate and hostile, and the party loses a key safe haven.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players choose to bargain with the Matriarch and embrace the thorn's power.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a "Thorn Boon" for each player, a powerful ability that comes with a permanent, corrupting curse. The campaign ends with the players as the new, powerful guardians of a spreading Bleak Thorn, setting up a darker future campaign.
