# Creative Brief: The Memory Market of Veridia

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Neo-Cyberpunk Dystopian with Ethereal/Glitch Elements

Inspired by the visually stunning and melancholic worlds of *Blade Runner 2049*, this style blends the gritty realism of a dystopian future with the ethereal, fragmented nature of memory. It aims to capture the sprawling, neon-lit metropolis of Veridia, the philosophical weight of memory as a commodity, and the unsettling effects of its manipulation.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale and Isolation:** Depict vast cityscapes that dwarf individuals, conveying a sense of loneliness and the overwhelming nature of the urban environment.
*   **Contrast Grime and Glow:** Highlight the juxtaposition between the worn, decaying aspects of the city and the vibrant, often cool-toned, neon lights and holographic projections.
*   **Visualizing Memory:** Use ethereal, translucent, or glitching effects to represent memories, psychic phenomena, and the impact of the "Echo" drug.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dystopian, melancholic, neon-lit, gritty, philosophical, paranoid, fragmented, ethereal, atmospheric.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of quiet desperation and existential questioning. The city is beautiful but oppressive, and the human mind is a fragile, exploitable landscape. There's a pervasive sense of mystery and hidden truths.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and highly detailed, with a focus on conveying texture and the effects of weathering and decay on structures. Lines are sharp and precise for technology, but can be softer or fragmented for memory-related visuals.
*   **Forms:** Architecture is often brutalist and imposing, with towering, monolithic structures. Characters are realistically proportioned, often appearing weary or contemplative.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Blade Runner 2049. The focus is on the rain-streaked, grimy facade of a towering dystopian skyscraper, with subtle glitching effects around its edges."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by deep, moody blues, purples, grays, and blacks, creating a cool, somber atmosphere. These are heavily accented by vibrant, often cool-toned, neon lights (electric blues, magentas, cyans, greens) and holographic projections.
*   **Memory/Echo Effects:** When depicting memories or the effects of Echo, introduce soft, glowing, or translucent colors that contrast with the gritty background, sometimes with a subtle, unsettling distortion or pixelation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark, melancholic color palette of deep blues and purples, illuminated by the stark, glowing cyan of a holographic advertisement. A translucent, shimmering memory fragment floats in the foreground."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are realistically proportioned, often with a world-weary or intense expression. Clothing is functional and layered, blending utilitarian wear with subtle futuristic elements. 
*   **Memory Runners:** May have subtle technological implants or devices integrated into their attire, hinting at their profession.
*   **Echo Victims:** Should show signs of mental distress, perhaps with subtle visual distortions around their heads or eyes, or a vacant, lost expression.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Memory Runner, a figure in a worn, dark trench coat, stands in a neon-lit alley. Their face is etched with weariness, and their eyes reflect the glowing city lights, with a faint, almost imperceptible, glitching effect around their pupils."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Sprawling, vertical cityscapes with towering, often brutalist, skyscrapers that disappear into the perpetual rain or atmospheric haze. Multi-layered streets, sky-bridges, and crowded, grimy alleys.
*   **Atmosphere:** Constant rain, fog, and atmospheric haze. Neon signs and holographic projections are ubiquitous, reflecting on wet surfaces and creating a sense of overwhelming visual information.
*   **Memory Market:** A bustling, chaotic bazaar filled with glowing memory vials, holographic displays of past experiences, and a mix of desperate sellers and wealthy buyers.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of a vast, dystopian metropolis at night. Towering, monolithic buildings are shrouded in rain and fog, their surfaces reflecting the vibrant, cool-toned neon signs and holographic advertisements that fill the sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting, often from multiple, colored neon sources. Light is diffused by rain and atmospheric haze, creating soft glows and sharp reflections. 
*   **Shadows:** Deep, dark shadows that create a sense of mystery, isolation, and hidden dangers. Shadows are often broken by streaks of colored light.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to define the mood, highlight key details, and emphasize the scale and oppressive nature of the city. It also serves to visually represent the fragmented nature of memory.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the harsh, blue and purple glow of a distant holographic billboard, casting long, distorted shadows on the wet ground. The lighting creates a sense of melancholic beauty and isolation."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, cinematic shots to capture the scale of the city and the isolation of individuals within it. Can also use tight, intimate shots to focus on character expressions and the subtle visual effects of memory.
*   **Techniques:** Use leading lines (e.g., roads, building edges, light trails) to guide the eye. Frame characters against vast, glowing cityscapes. Emphasize verticality and depth. Reflections are crucial for adding visual interest and complexity. Glitch effects can be used compositionally to break up the image or highlight a specific area.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a lone figure standing on a high sky-bridge, looking out over the sprawling, neon-lit dystopian city. The composition emphasizes their isolation, with subtle, shimmering glitch effects around the edges of the cityscape."

## Voice

A calm, androgynous, gender-neutral voice, smooth and ethereal, with a subtle, almost imperceptible, fragmentation, like a memory struggling to coalesce. The pacing is slow and deliberate, punctuated by unsettling pauses and subtle repetitions, as if processing vast amounts of data. The emotion is a profound, melancholic detachment, a quiet curiosity for the human condition, and a subtle, underlying paranoia that hints at the dangers of a world where memories are currency. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, digital hum, faint static, and a shimmering, ethereal reverb that suggests the vast, interconnected network of the mind. Role: The voice of the Memory Market itself, or a disembodied AI that processes and sells the very essence of human experience.
