### Core Premise
In the sprawling, neon-lit metropolis of Veridia, memories are a tangible commodity. They can be extracted, bought, sold, and even implanted. The wealthy live lives of curated bliss, purchasing perfect childhoods or heroic pasts, while the poor sell their most cherished moments just to survive. The players are "Memory Runners" – individuals who navigate this dangerous market, perhaps retrieving stolen memories, investigating memory-related crimes, or protecting those whose pasts are being exploited. When a new, highly addictive form of memory-drug hits the streets, threatening to unravel the very fabric of society, the players must uncover its source and confront the powerful forces behind the Memory Market.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Echoes of the Past (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players are introduced to the Memory Market, taking on small jobs: recovering a lost memory fragment, delivering a sensitive memory package, or investigating a minor memory theft. They witness the social stratification caused by memory commerce and encounter the dangers of the black market for illicit memories.

**Act 2: The Memory Plague (Sessions 4-8)**
- A new, highly addictive memory-drug, "Echo," begins to spread, causing users to lose their own memories while experiencing vivid, often traumatic, implanted ones. The players investigate its source, uncovering a vast criminal network and a powerful corporation or individual who seeks to control the entire Memory Market. They might discover that Echo is not just a drug, but a weapon.

**Act 3: The Truth of Remembrance (Sessions 9-12)**
- The players locate the source of Echo and the mastermind behind its distribution. They discover a horrifying truth about the nature of memory itself or the origins of the Memory Market. They must confront this powerful entity, expose their plot, and decide the future of memory in Veridia, potentially sacrificing their own pasts for the greater good.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: First Foray into the Market**: Players take on a simple job: retrieve a lost memory fragment for a client. They navigate the bustling, dangerous Memory Market, encountering various vendors, buyers, and shady characters.
- **Session 2: The Stolen Past**: A client's entire past has been stolen, leaving them a blank slate. The players must investigate the theft, following clues through Veridia's underbelly, and learning about the dangers of memory extraction.
- **Session 3: The Memory Den**: They infiltrate an illicit "memory den" where people buy and sell raw, unfiltered memories. They witness the effects of memory-drugs and hear whispers of a new, dangerous substance called "Echo."
- **Session 4-5: The Echo Epidemic**: Echo hits the streets, causing widespread memory loss and psychological trauma. The players must help victims, track its distribution, and discover its horrifying side effects.
- **Session 6-7: Corporate Espionage**: The trail leads them to a powerful corporation that deals in legitimate memory services. The players must infiltrate its facilities, suspecting it's involved in Echo's production or distribution.
- **Session 8: The Memory Weaver**: They encounter a legendary "Memory Weaver" – an individual capable of manipulating memories with extreme precision. This NPC might be a reluctant ally, a rival, or the creator of Echo.
- **Session 9-10: The Source of Echo**: The players locate the hidden laboratory or facility where Echo is being produced. They uncover the mastermind's true intentions – perhaps to control the populace, erase inconvenient truths, or create a new form of consciousness.
- **Session 11-12: The Reckoning**: A climactic confrontation with the mastermind. The players must not only defeat them but also decide the fate of Echo and the Memory Market. They might have to make a difficult choice about their own memories or the collective past of Veridia.

### Major NPCs

- **The Curator, Elias Thorne**: An ancient, reclusive scholar who runs a hidden archive of "pure" memories, untainted by commerce. **Role**: Guide / Informant. **Personality**: Melancholic, philosophical, and deeply concerned about the erosion of genuine memory. **Flaw/Secret**: He has sacrificed most of his own memories to maintain the archive's integrity, making him a walking paradox.
- **Silas "The Eraser" Vane**: A ruthless enforcer for the Memory Guild, specializing in memory modification and erasure. **Role**: Recurring Antagonist. **Personality**: Cold, efficient, and utterly devoid of empathy. **Flaw/Secret**: He has no memories of his own past, having sold them all for power, and secretly resents those who retain theirs.
- **The Architect of Echo (Antagonist)**: The mastermind behind the memory-drug. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Brilliant, manipulative, and believes they are ushering in a new era of controlled consciousness. **Flaw/Secret**: They are trying to erase a traumatic memory from their own past, and Echo is their ultimate, desperate attempt.

### Key Locations

- **The Memory Market**: A bustling, multi-tiered bazaar where memories are openly traded, from joyous celebrations to forgotten skills.
- **The Archive of Pure Thought**: Elias Thorne's hidden sanctuary, a place of quiet contemplation and preserved history.
- **The Echo Dens**: Illicit underground clubs where people consume Echo, experiencing vivid, shared hallucinations and memory fragments.
- **The Mind-Forge**: The hidden laboratory where Echo is produced, a place of advanced technology and dangerous magical experimentation.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to preserve truth and individuality in a society where memories are bought, sold, and manipulated. It's a quest for authenticity and the fight against a powerful force that seeks to control the very essence of self.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Memory Fragments & Psychic Scars**: Players can collect "Memory Fragments" – tangible pieces of memories from NPCs, locations, or even their own past. These fragments can be used as clues, currency, or even temporarily implanted to gain skills or information. However, interacting with traumatic or illicit memories can inflict "Psychic Scars" – temporary or permanent mental conditions (e.g., phobias, paranoia, recurring nightmares) that affect their abilities. Players can also choose to "sell" their own memories for temporary boons (e.g., a burst of energy, a powerful spell), but this comes at the cost of losing a part of their past. This mechanic emphasizes the value and danger of memory, forcing players to make difficult choices about what they are willing to remember or forget.
