# Creative Brief: The Devil's Herd

## Logline
Based on Australia's real-life "Great Emu War" of 1932, players are survivors in a modern-day apocalypse where an ancient earth-spirit has granted terrifying intelligence to the continent's fauna. They must cross the hostile outback, battling mobs of killer kangaroos and tactical emus to reach humanity's last safe haven.

## Genre

*   **Grounded in Absurd History:** The campaign's origin is a real, and very strange, historical event.

## Voice

A grizzled, older male voice, dry and gravelly like the sun-baked earth, with a thick, rural Australian accent that crackles with the heat of the outback. His pacing is a rapid-fire, slightly breathless rhythm, punctuated by nervous chuckles and sudden bursts of urgency, as if constantly scanning the horizon for threats. The emotion is a blend of cynical humor, barely suppressed panic, and a deep, abiding respect for the terrifying intelligence of the enemy. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, but with a subtle, ambient static and the faint, distant sounds of screeching emus and thundering kangaroo hooves. Role: A survivor broadcasting a desperate warning over a salvaged radio, or a seasoned outback warrior recounting the horrors of the Emu War.
