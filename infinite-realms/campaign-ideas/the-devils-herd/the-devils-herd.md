# The Devil's Herd

## Real-World Basis: The Great Emu War
In 1932, the Australian military, facing a plague of 20,000 emus destroying farmland, declared "war" on the birds. They deployed soldiers armed with Lewis machine guns. The emus, however, proved to be masters of guerrilla tactics, splitting into small groups and running in unpredictable patterns. The military expended thousands of rounds of ammunition for very few kills. The campaign was a humiliating failure and a national embarrassment.

## The RPG Twist
The emus weren't just dumb birds. They were the chosen vessels of an ancient, malevolent earth-spirit of the Outback, a being of pure, spiteful survival. The "war" was its first modern experiment in asymmetric warfare. Now, having learned from the encounter, the spirit has expanded its influence. It has animated the most dangerous and resilient fauna of Australia, creating a unified, intelligent, and bloodthirsty army.

## Campaign Premise (Man-vs-Nature/Apocalyptic Action)
The players are a small group of survivors in the Australian Outback (park rangers, scientists, hardened locals) when the apocalypse begins. It's not zombies or nukes; it's nature fighting back with terrifying intelligence. Kangaroos with reinforced bone spurs attack in coordinated mobs. Cassowaries act as elite shock troops. Spiders weave immense, tactical webs to trap vehicles. And leading them all is the "Devil's Herd"—a new generation of emus, faster, smarter, and burning with an infernal intelligence. The players must survive, gather other survivors, and cross the continent to a supposed safe zone, all while being hunted by the most dangerous fauna on the planet.

## Key Elements
*   **The Red Earth Army:** The collective name for the hostile fauna. Each species has a role. Emus are the strategists and cavalry. Kangaroos are the brawlers. Cassowaries are elite assassins. Kookaburras are scouts whose laughter is a terrifying battle cry.
*   **The Environment as an Enemy:** The Australian Outback is already one of the most hostile environments on Earth. Now, it's actively trying to kill you. The sun is brutal, water is scarce, and every shadow could hide a venomous creature.
*   **Scavenging and Crafting:** Survival depends on what you can find and what you can build. Vehicles must be reinforced and jury-rigged. Weapons are cobbled together. Finding a working petrol station is like finding the Holy Grail.
*   **The Spirit's Influence:** The earth-spirit's influence is a palpable force. It can cause flash floods, dust storms, and create "hot zones" of hyper-aggressive wildlife. Its ultimate goal is to scour the continent clean of human influence.

## Tone
*Mad Max: Fury Road* meets a terrifying version of *The Wild Thornberrys*. A high-octane, gritty survival game where humanity is on the back foot and the biggest threat is a two-legged bird with a machine-gunner's brain.
