# Creative Brief: The Long Look

## Logline
Players are the psychic descendants of the CIA's real-life "Stargate Project," a secret program that didn't just spy on enemies, but accidentally opened doors to other realities. Now, they must master their inherited powers to close these psychic breaches before the entities leaking through unravel our world.

## Genre
Modern Conspiracy, Occult Thriller

## Key Features
*   **Grounded in Real Conspiracy:** Based on the declassified Stargate Project, lending an air of authenticity to the weirdness.
*   **Rules-Light Psychic System:** Focuses on narrative abilities like remote viewing and psychic investigation rather than combat-heavy powers.
*   **Slow-Burn Horror:** Emphasis on psychological dread, mystery, and the uncanny rather than jump scares or overt monsters.
*   **A Hidden World:** Players are initiated into a secret war for reality, operating in the shadows of our modern world.

## Target Audience
Fans of *Delta Green*, *Control*, *The X-Files*, and *Fringe*. Players who enjoy investigation, conspiracy theories, and psychological horror over traditional action.

## Voice

A calm, detached male voice, flat and monotonous, like a redacted government recording played in a sterile, soundproof room. His standard American accent is clinical and precise, with a slow, deliberate pacing that conveys a chilling sense of bureaucratic indifference to the supernatural. The emotion is a complete lack of human feeling, replaced by a cold, detached observation and the quiet horror of a world unraveling. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, but with a pervasive, ambient static and the faint, almost subliminal, sound of a tape recorder clicking on and off. Role: The voice of a declassified government training tape, or a psychic agent giving a debriefing from beyond the veil.
