# The Long Look

## Real-World Basis: The Stargate Project
From the 1970s to 1995, the CIA and DIA spent $20 million on a program to train "remote viewers"—psychic spies who could supposedly see locations and events from thousands of miles away. The project was declassified and officially deemed a failure.

## The RPG Twist
The project wasn't a failure; it was *too* successful. The remote viewers didn't just *see* things in our world. In their trance-like states, they looked "sideways" into adjacent realities and made contact with the things that live there. These entities, which operate on different physical and moral laws, became aware of us. The Stargate Project was shut down in a panic to "close the doors" they had opened. Now, those doors are beginning to splinter.

## Campaign Premise (Modern Conspiracy/Occult)
The players are individuals who experience "glitches" in reality—lost time, seeing things in reflections that aren't there, deja vu that feels like a warning. They are descendants of the original remote viewers, inheriting a faint echo of their psychic talent. This "scent" makes them targets for the entities leaking into our world and also brings them to the attention of the program's aging, paranoid survivors. The players must learn to control their latent abilities to perceive and "seal" these psychic breaches, all while being hunted by both otherworldly horrors and a government that wants to erase all evidence of its greatest secret.

## Key Elements
*   **The Sight:** The core mechanic. Players can attempt to "view" remote locations, past events, or even the psychic space between realities. Doing so is mentally taxing and risks attracting the attention of hostile entities.
*   **The Breach:** The space between worlds. When players use their powers, they interact with this space. It's a non-euclidean, conceptual realm where thoughts have weight and attention is a tangible force.
*   **The Entities:** These are not typical monsters. They are concepts, memes, and beings of pure information that "leak" into our world. An "Echo" might be a person stuck in a time loop. A "Static Man" might be a being of pure data that corrupts technology around it. A "Tulpamancer" might be an entity that brings fears to life.
*   **The Network:** The players are not alone. They are part of a loose, underground network of other "sensitives" and the grizzled ex-agents of the original Stargate Project. This network provides cryptic guidance, training, and a fragile support system.

## Tone
*Delta Green* meets *Fringe*, a slow-burn psychological thriller about the walls of reality thinning. The game is about investigation, conspiracy, and the creeping dread that the world is more fragile than it appears.
