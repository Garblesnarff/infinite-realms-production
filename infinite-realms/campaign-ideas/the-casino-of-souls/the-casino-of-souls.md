## What “Hard” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The Casino of Souls is a place of immense power and danger. The party will face off against powerful devils, cunning demons, and the casino's own, unique security forces. A straight-up fight is almost always a losing proposition.
*   **The Heist:** This is a complex, multi-stage heist that will require meticulous planning, flawless execution, and a lot of luck. The party will need to use all of their skills, wits, and resources to succeed.
*   **Consequences:** Failure is not an option. If the party is caught, they will not be sent to jail. They will be forced to sign a contract with Mammon, forfeiting their own souls and becoming his eternal servants.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Heat**

*   The DM will track the party's "Heat" level, which represents how much attention they have attracted from the casino's security. The Heat level will increase as the party takes risks and makes mistakes.
*   **Effects:** As the Heat level increases, the security will become tighter, new traps will be activated, and more powerful demons will be dispatched to deal with the party.

### 2. **The Con**

*   The heist is a complex operation that will require the party to play a variety of roles and execute a series of cons. The DM can create a flowchart or a planning board to help the party visualize the different stages of the heist and the roles that each of them will play.

### 3. **Contracts and Bargains**

*   In the world of devils, a contract is a binding agreement. The party will have the opportunity to make deals with various demonic entities, but they must be careful. The devil is in the details, and a poorly worded contract can have disastrous consequences.
