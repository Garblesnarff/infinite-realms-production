# The Felidae Conspiracy

## Real-World Basis: Project Acoustic Kitty
In the 1960s, the CIA spent a reported $20 million trying to turn a cat into a sophisticated listening device. They surgically implanted a microphone, a transmitter, and an antenna into a live cat, intending to have it eavesdrop on Soviet officials. The project's first and only field test ended in failure when, upon being released, the cat was immediately hit and killed by a taxi.

## The RPG Twist
The "taxi incident" was a cover story. The initial subject, and the dozens that followed, didn't just become listening devices. The cybernetic implants, interacting with the unique structure of the feline brain, created a low-level telepathic network. The "Acoustic Kitties" escaped, formed a collective consciousness, and now operate as the ultimate intelligence network, manipulating global events from the shadows of the world's alleys and apartments.

## Campaign Premise (Spy-Fi/Dark Comedy)
The players are a team of disgraced agents, eccentric veterinarians, or even just unlucky animal control officers who stumble upon the truth. They discover that the animal kingdom is not what it seems—pigeons are data couriers, squirrels are saboteurs, and at the top of it all is the Feline Intelligence Network (FIN). The players are recruited by a desperate and under-funded government agency (or a rival intelligence service like MI6) to counter this threat. They must outwit telepathic cats, dismantle networks of animal agents, and stop FIN from executing its ultimate goal: "The Great Scratching Post," a plan to neutralize humanity and establish a global cat-ocracy.

## Key Elements
*   **The Network (FIN):** The primary antagonist. FIN is not a single entity, but a gestalt consciousness of thousands of cats. It is cunning, patient, and utterly convinced of its own superiority. Its "orders" are communicated through subtle telepathic nudges and control over other, less intelligent animals.
*   **Animal Agents:** The players will face off against surprisingly effective animal operatives. A flock of pigeons might create a communications blackout. A pack of stray dogs might stage a coordinated ambush. A single, well-placed housecat could be the most dangerous spy in the world.
*   **Tradecraft vs. Instinct:** The players have human technology and training. FIN has the advantage of being everywhere and being completely underestimated. A mission might fail not because of a rival spy, but because a player is allergic to the primary suspect.
*   **The Comedy of the Mundane:** The campaign's humor comes from the juxtaposition of high-stakes espionage with the mundane reality of dealing with animals. A car chase might be interrupted by the need to stop for a flock of ducks. An interrogation of a key witness might be impossible because their cat is sitting on their face.

## Tone
*Men in Black* meets *Cats & Dogs* played completely straight, with the grim lethality of a John le Carré novel. A game of paranoia, absurdity, and never, ever trusting a purr.
