### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Felidae Conspiracy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The tone is a dark comedy and spy-fi thriller.
*   **Content:** The CIA's failed 1960s "Acoustic Kitty" project was secretly a success, creating a telepathic network of feline spies that now secretly runs the world. The players are a rag-tag group of agents and animal experts who stumble upon this truth and must stop the Feline Intelligence Network (FIN) before humanity is permanently declawed by their master plan, "The Great Scratching Post."

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the "true" history of the CIA's Project Acoustic Kitty, including the cover-up.
    *   Write the story of how the first cybernetically enhanced cats formed the Feline Intelligence Network (FIN).
    *   Describe the hierarchy of the animal kingdom under FIN's control (e.g., pigeons as couriers, squirrels as saboteurs).
    *   Explain the nature of the feline telepathic network. How do they communicate? What are its limitations?
    *   Detail a major historical event from the last 50 years that was secretly orchestrated by FIN for their own benefit.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Agency (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To expose and dismantle the Feline Intelligence Network.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A small, underfunded, and officially deniable government agency (or a private group of conspiracy theorists).
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They operate in complete secrecy.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To prevent a global panic and a potential war between humans and the animal kingdom.
        *   **Assets:** Their unique skills, a few gadgets, and the element of surprise.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by FIN; viewed as crackpots by the wider intelligence community.
    *   **The Feline Intelligence Network (FIN)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To execute "The Great Scratching Post," a plan to neutralize humanity and establish a global cat-ocracy.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A decentralized gestalt consciousness, with certain elder cats acting as major nodes in the network.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To be cute, aloof, and demand food.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To manipulate human society towards collapse and ensure the dominance of the feline species.
        *   **Assets:** A global network of millions of cat spies, control over other animal species, the ability to be completely underestimated.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonists, viewing humans as clumsy, loud, and inferior beings to be managed.
    *   **The Canine Loyalty League (CLL)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To protect humanity and expose FIN's conspiracy.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A secret society of intelligent dogs, bred and trained for generations to combat the feline threat.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To be good boys.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To prove, once and for all, that dogs are better than cats.
        *   **Assets:** A network of loyal canine agents, a keen sense of smell for detecting feline spies, unwavering loyalty to their human companions.
        *   **Relationships:** A potential, if sometimes slobbery, ally for the players.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Mittens, First of His Name:** An ancient, fluffy Persian cat who is one of the original Acoustic Kitties and a primary node of FIN.
    *   **Agent Rex:** A grizzled, cybernetically enhanced Corgi who is a high-ranking agent of the Canine Loyalty League.
    *   **The Director:** The paranoid, chain-smoking, and perpetually stressed human leader of the players' agency.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Smug, Telepathic Housecat (FIN Agent)"
    *   "Pigeon Data-Courier (Creature)"
    *   "Squirrel Saboteur (Creature)"
    *   "Human oblivious to their cat's true nature"
    *   "Loyal Golden Retriever (CLL Agent)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **A FIN Safe House (An Ordinary Apartment):** A seemingly normal apartment, secretly a hub for local feline agents.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The scratching post (a communications hub), the litter box (a document shredder), the window sill (a surveillance post), the food bowl (a dead drop).
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** A cell of FIN cat agents, their oblivious human owner.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Stolen information, half-eaten mice.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** The human owner comes home unexpectedly, a rival cat gang challenges the local agents for territory, a pigeon courier arrives with a message, a player has an allergic reaction, the cats attempt to telepathically influence a player to give them treats.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The local FIN cell is planning to replace the mayor's dog with a canine-impersonating cat." "The password for the local network is hidden in the pattern of scratches on the scratching post." "Mittens himself is scheduled to visit this safe house."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (A normal apartment, but with an unnerving number of cats staring at you), Sound (Purring, the clinking of cat collars, the human watching TV), Smell (Cat food, litter box, a faint smell of ozone).
    *   **A CLL Kennel Club:** The secret headquarters of the Canine Loyalty League, hidden beneath a prestigious dog show.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The grooming station (a front for a Q-branch style lab), the obstacle course (a training ground for agents), the trophy room (a museum of past victories against FIN), the main briefing room.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Intelligent dogs of all breeds, a few trusted human handlers.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Canine-sized gadgets, information from their own intelligence network, unwavering loyalty.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A new litter of puppies is being trained, Agent Rex demonstrates a new gadget, a FIN agent (a cat in a dog costume) is discovered, the party must participate in the dog show as a cover, a debate breaks out over the best way to get belly rubs.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Agent Rex has a personal vendetta against Mittens." "The CLL has developed a device that can temporarily block feline telepathy." "They have a map of FIN's primary communication nodes."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Well-groomed dogs, advanced but hidden technology, trophies), Sound (Barking, the hum of computers, the commands of handlers), Smell (Dog shampoo, leather, determination).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully capture and interrogate a FIN agent (a cat).
    *   **THEN:** The cat reveals a piece of information, but also telepathically alerts the entire local network to the players' location and methods, causing all other cats in the area to become actively hostile and suspicious.
    *   **IF:** The players are witnessed being cruel to an animal (even a non-FIN one).
    *   **THEN:** Their public reputation suffers. Animal rights groups protest their agency, and they find it harder to operate in public. The Canine Loyalty League may refuse to work with them.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully plant a listening device on a pigeon courier.
    *   **THEN:** They begin to intercept FIN's communications, gaining a significant advantage. However, this also allows FIN to feed them false information, leading to a potential trap.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to ally with the Canine Loyalty League.
    *   **THEN:** They gain a powerful ally and access to their resources, but must also participate in missions that are important to the CLL but may not directly relate to stopping FIN (e.g., rescuing a captured dog agent, sabotaging a cat food factory).
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players have the opportunity to neutralize the entire FIN network but it would also erase the intelligence of all cats.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a moral dilemma. Do they commit a form of genocide to save humanity, or do they find another way, risking that FIN will one day return?
