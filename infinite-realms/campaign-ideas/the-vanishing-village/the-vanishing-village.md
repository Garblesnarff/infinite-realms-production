## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the terror of being hunted, the methodology of investigation, and the horror of discovering humanity's place in a larger, more dangerous universe. The central conflict revolves around otherworldly predators who treat humans as game animals in an interstellar hunting ritual. The players must use logic, deduction, and careful observation to understand these beings' weaknesses while avoiding becoming victims themselves. The investigation reveals uncomfortable truths about humanity's vulnerability and the existence of forces that view us as nothing more than prey.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Investigation Point System**
*   Players accumulate "Investigation Points" through careful observation, clue analysis, and deduction.
*   Investigation Points can be spent for "revelations" - moments of sudden insight that reveal important connections.
*   The system encourages methodical, evidence-based gameplay over random guessing.

### 2. **The Echo Recorder**
*   A device that can capture and replay "echoes" - residual psychic impressions of the villagers' final moments.
*   Players must interpret these echoes correctly to gain clues, but watching them risks psychological effects.
*   The device evolves based on player modifications, potentially allowing communication with the otherworldly predators.

### 3. **Predator Awareness Track**
*   Players track how aware the predators are of their investigation.
*   High awareness leads to more aggressive hunting and direct confrontations.
*   Players can reduce awareness through stealth, misdirection, or by providing the predators with alternative "prey."
