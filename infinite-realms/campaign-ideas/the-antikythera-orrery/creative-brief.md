*   **High-Stakes Intrigue:** The campaign is driven by a "cold war" between divine powers, forcing players to rely on wits, diplomacy, and stealth over open combat.
*   **Themes of Prophecy and Fate:** A story that engages with classic D&D themes of destiny and free will, where players must decide whether to follow or defy prophecy.

## Target Audience
Players who love deep lore, political intrigue, and high-concept fantasy. Fans of adventures that involve the gods and the outer planes, and campaigns where a single artifact can change the course of history.

## Voice

An ancient, gender-neutral voice, soft and clear, with a faint metallic or crystalline resonance, like the turning gears of a divine clockwork. The pacing is measured and deliberate, each word a precise calculation, devoid of human emotion. The emotion is a profound, cosmic indifference, a pure, unfiltered stream of information that hints at the vast, interconnected tapestry of fate. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, shimmering, and slightly discordant echo, as if emanating from the artifact itself. Role: The voice of the Antikythera Orrery, speaking its prophecies and calculations, or the disembodied voice of destiny.
