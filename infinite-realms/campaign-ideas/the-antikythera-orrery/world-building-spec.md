### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Antikythera Orrery**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players, hired for a shipwreck salvage, discover the Antikythera Orrery, a divine artifact that tracks the flow of cosmic power and predicts the future. The moment they surface with it, its power radiates, and they are plunged into a divine cold war. Multiple factions representing gods of knowledge, destruction, and secrets move to claim the device, forcing the players to protect the artifact, decipher its prophecies, and navigate a world of celestial espionage.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the true origin of the Orrery. Was it created by a god of knowledge, a relic from the Dawn War, or something else?
    *   Write the history of the shipwreck from which the Orrery was salvaged. Who were they, and why did they have the device?
    *   Describe the core tenets and beliefs of the three main divine philosophies involved: Knowledge (Preservation), Destruction (Fatalism), and Secrets (Suppression).
    *   Explain the mechanics of divine power in this setting. How do gods gain and lose influence?
    *   Detail a past prophecy that was fulfilled and its consequences, establishing the Orrery's power.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Lorekeepers** (Good/Neutral)
        *   **Goals:** To secure and study the Orrery to prepare the world for future threats.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A network of clerics and scholars, reporting to the high priests of a god of knowledge (e.g., Oghma, Ioun).
        *   **Public Agenda:** To preserve knowledge and protect the world from cosmic dangers.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They believe the Orrery's prophecies are mutable and want to use its knowledge to guide the world towards a "correct" future.
        *   **Assets:** A network of libraries and monasteries, powerful divination magic, celestial allies (angels).
        *   **Relationships:** See the Fatalists as dangerous nihilists and the Silencers as short-sighted fools.
    *   **The Fatalists** (Evil)
        *   **Goals:** To use the Orrery to find the most opportune moments to strike and bring their destructive god to power.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A fanatical cult led by a charismatic high priest or priestess.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To embrace the inevitable and prepare the world for the coming end.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To trigger a prophesied apocalypse at the most advantageous moment for their deity.
        *   **Assets:** Fanatical followers willing to die for the cause, infernal allies (devils), powerful offensive magic.
        *   **Relationships:** Actively hunt the players for the Orrery; see the other factions as obstacles to fate.
    *   **The Silencers** (Neutral/Evil)
        *   **Goals:** To capture and suppress or destroy the Orrery, believing its knowledge is too dangerous for anyone to possess.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A clandestine network of spies and assassins, loyal to a god of secrets (e.g., Vecna) or an Archdevil.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They operate in complete secrecy.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To prevent a specific, catastrophic prophecy that involves their own master's demise.
        *   **Assets:** A network of spies in all other factions, stealth technology and magic, the ability to erase memories.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to anyone possessing the Orrery; will use the other factions as pawns.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **High Loremaster Arcanus:** The wise and patient leader of the Lorekeepers, who urges caution and study.
    *   **Harbinger Kael:** The charismatic and ruthless leader of the Fatalists, who believes he is an agent of destiny.
    *   **The Veiled Hand:** The enigmatic, faceless leader of the Silencers, who communicates only through encoded messages.

        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The ship's log hints at why they were transporting the Orrery." "The captain was a secret member of one of the factions." "There is other, non-magical treasure here to be found."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Murky water, shifting light from the surface, ancient wood), Sound (Muffled silence, the bubbling of air, the distant calls of whales), Smell (Brine, wet wood).
    *   **The Lorekeeper's Athenaeum:** A grand, fortified library-monastery where the Lorekeepers wish to study the Orrery.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Great Orrery Stand (prepared for the device), the Vault of Forbidden Prophecies, the Scrying Pools, the Celestial Observatory.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Scholars, clerics, celestial guardians, librarians.

        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "High Loremaster Arcanus fears a prophecy about his own death." "The Vault of Forbidden Prophecies contains predictions the Lorekeepers don't want anyone to see." "A high-ranking member of the Athenaeum is a mole for the Fatalists."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Towering bookshelves, stained-glass windows depicting cosmic events, floating celestial orbs), Sound (The rustle of pages, quiet chanting, the hum of divination magic), Smell (Old parchment, incense, clean stone).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully learn to operate a basic function of the Orrery.
    *   **THEN:** The Orrery shows them a cryptic vision of an impending attack. Generate a short, timed mission where the players must act on this limited information to prevent an assassination or theft.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to ally with the Lorekeepers and deliver the Orrery to them.
    *   **THEN:** The campaign shifts to defending the Athenaeum. Generate a series of missions focused on protecting the library from infiltration by the Fatalists and Silencers.
    *   **IF:** The players attempt to defy a prophecy shown by the Orrery.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a scenario where their actions inadvertently cause the prophecy to come true in an unexpected, often more tragic, way (a self-fulfilling prophecy).
    *   **IF:** The players use the Orrery to learn a terrible secret about one of the "good" gods.
    *   **THEN:** The god itself takes notice, dispatching its own agents to retrieve the Orrery and silence the players, turning a potential ally into a powerful foe.
    *   **IF:** The players decide that the Orrery is too dangerous and attempt to destroy it.
    *   **THEN:** All three factions unite against them. Generate a final, desperate chase sequence where the players are hunted by angels, devils, and fanatics, all seeking to claim the artifact before it can be unmade.
