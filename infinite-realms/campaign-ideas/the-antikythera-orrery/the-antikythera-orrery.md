# The Antikythera Orrery

## Real-World Basis: The Antikythera Mechanism
An incredibly intricate hand-powered orrery recovered from a shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera. Created around 100 BC, it is often called the first analog computer. Its complex system of bronze gears could predict astronomical positions, eclipses, and even the cycles of the Olympic Games. Its technological sophistication would not be seen again for over a thousand years.

## D&D Twist
The device was not built by mortals. It is a divine artifact, a relic from the Dawn War between the gods and the primordials, or perhaps a tool created by a god of knowledge like Oghma or Ioun. It does not merely track the movements of the celestial bodies; it tracks the flow of divine power throughout the cosmos. It maps the shifting alignments of the planes, predicts the birth and death of gods, and calculates the precise moments of prophetic convergence. It is a divine threat-assessment engine and a map of the future.

## Campaign Premise (Arcane Mystery/Divine Intrigue)
The players, hired for a simple shipwreck salvage operation, discover the Orrery in a lead-lined chest, perfectly preserved. The moment they bring it to the surface, its power radiates outwards, and powerful factions move to claim it. The players are now caught in a divine cold war. Agents of multiple faiths and powers want the device:
*   **The Lorekeepers (Good/Neutral):** Clerics of a God of Knowledge who want to study the Orrery in a secure vault to prepare the world for coming threats.
*   **The Fatalists (Evil):** A cult dedicated to a God of Destruction (like Bane) or a Demon Lord, who want to use the Orrery to find the most opportune moments to strike and bring their master to power.
*   **The Silencers (Neutral/Evil):** Agents of a God of Secrets (like Vecna) or a paranoid Archdevil, who believe the device holds too much power for anyone to possess and seek to capture and suppress it, or destroy it entirely.
The players must protect the artifact, learn to decipher its complex predictions, and navigate a treacherous landscape of divine politics, all while being hunted by angels, devils, and mortal fanatics.

## Key Elements
*   **The Ultimate MacGuffin:** The Orrery is a dynamic artifact. As the campaign progresses, the players can learn to use it, gaining cryptic but powerful glimpses of the future, warnings of impending attacks, or clues to the locations of other powerful artifacts.
*   **A Divine Cold War:** The conflict is not open warfare, but one of spies, assassins, and manipulation. The players can't solve their problems with a simple fireball, as their enemies have divine backing. They must choose their allies carefully.
*   **Prophecy and Free Will:** The campaign explores themes of fate and destiny. The Orrery's predictions are accurate, but are they inevitable? Can the players defy prophecy, or does their attempt to avert a disaster only ensure that it happens?
*   **Planar Stakes:** The information provided by the Orrery deals with the highest levels of the cosmos. The players might learn of a coming celestial convergence, an impending demonic invasion, or the planned assassination of a lesser deity, raising the stakes from personal survival to the fate of the multiverse.

## Tone
*The Da Vinci Code* meets *Planescape*. A high-stakes adventure of mystery, prophecy, and divine espionage, where the players are small pieces in a cosmic chess game.
