# The White Leviathan

## Real-World Basis: Project Habakkuk
During WWII, the British seriously considered building a massive, unstoppable aircraft carrier out of "pykrete," a mixture of wood pulp and ice. The planned vessel, HMS *Habakkuk*, was to be over a mile long, impervious to torpedoes, and act as a floating island for launching aircraft in the mid-Atlantic. The project was ultimately abandoned as impractical.

## The RPG Twist
The project wasn't abandoned. A prototype was secretly built in a remote Arctic fjord. But the pykrete, made from ancient glacial ice, contained more than just frozen water. It held dormant, extremophilic microorganisms that, over decades, formed a collective consciousness within the vessel. The HMS *Habakkuk* is now a living, sentient, and hostile iceberg-dreadnought.

## Campaign Premise (Sci-Fi/Survival Horror)
It is the modern day. The *Habakkuk* has awakened. It's slowly drifting south from the Arctic, its immense cold altering weather patterns and its internal structure constantly shifting and "calving" crystalline ice-monsters. The players are a specialist team (scientists, engineers, soldiers) sent to board the "White Leviathan." Their mission is to navigate the frozen, non-euclidean corridors of the living ship, contend with the bizarre ice-fauna it generates, and either find a way to destroy its "heart" or stop the ancient intelligence that now pilots it before it reaches populated coastlines.

## Key Elements
*   **The Ship:** The *Habakkuk* is the main character and the dungeon. Its corridors and chambers shift and reconfigure. Sections might "melt" and "refreeze" into new layouts. Power conduits are veins of super-chilled water, and the hum of the engine is a slow, biological pulse.
*   **The Fauna:** The microorganisms within the ice can manifest as independent creatures. These "Cryo-Clones" can be crystalline mimics of the original crew, predatory ice-spiders, or massive brutes of pure, compressed ice.
*   **The Environment:** The primary enemy is the cold. Players will need specialized gear to survive. Light sources are critical, as darkness in the heart of the ship is absolute.
*   **The Goal:** The central mystery is the nature of the intelligence. Is it a single entity? A hive mind? Can it be communicated with? The ultimate goal is to reach the ship's core—the original reactor room, now a vast cavern of glowing, sentient ice—and sever its connection to the vessel.

## Tone
*The Thing* meets *Event Horizon* on a colossal, shifting dungeon made of ice. A game of exploration, resource management, and survival against a truly alien and overwhelming environment.
