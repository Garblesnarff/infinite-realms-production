## Voice

A cold, ageless, gender-neutral voice, like the groaning of immense ice sheets or the deep, resonant hum of a colossal, malevolent entity. The timbre is subtly crackling, with a pervasive, low-frequency rumble that suggests the immense pressure of the deep ocean and the chilling indifference of a frozen, alien intelligence. The pacing is slow and deliberate, each word drawn out with unnerving pauses, emphasizing the profound loneliness and the chilling grandeur of a forgotten civilization's demise. The emotion is a complete lack of human feeling, replaced by a sense of detached observation and the quiet horror of a dead, decaying world. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, but with a pervasive, ambient static and the faint, distant sound of creaking ice and mournful, wind-swept cries. Role: The voice of the White Leviathan itself, or the collective, psychic echo of its frozen victims.
