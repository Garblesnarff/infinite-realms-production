*A Multiverse Adventure Campaign — Long Campaign (11-13 sessions) — High difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Planar Convergence: Shattered Reality
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Multiverse Adventure / Cosmic Horror / Planar Travel
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 11-13 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **12**
**Tone (keywords):** epic, cosmic, reality-bending, philosophical, consequence-heavy
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
Reality itself is unraveling as the barriers between planes of existence begin to collapse, causing impossible phenomena to bleed into the material world. The players, initially drawn together by a shared vision of cosmic catastrophe, discover they are "Planar Anchors" - rare individuals who can stabilize reality tears and travel between dimensions. As they journey across increasingly unstable planes, they uncover an ancient entity that seeks to reshape existence according to its own design. The players must master the fundamental forces of reality itself while deciding whether to preserve the multiverse as it is or embrace the terrifying potential of total convergence.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the nature of reality, the responsibility of power, and the consequences of playing with existence itself. The central conflict revolves around the Convergence Entity's plan to reshape reality according to its vision of perfection. The players must navigate increasingly unstable planes while grappling with their own growing power to alter reality. The campaign forces difficult questions: Is the current multiverse worth preserving? What right do mortals have to reshape existence? And what does it mean to be "real" in a universe where reality itself is breaking down?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Planar Stability System**
*   Players track "Reality Stability" representing their ability to maintain coherence across planes.
*   Low stability causes reality-warping effects, while high stability allows reality manipulation.
*   Players can spend stability for powerful effects but risk losing their sense of self.

### 2. **The Convergence Map**
*   A ever-changing map showing the multiverse's current state and convergence points.
*   Players must interpret shifting symbols and solve planar puzzles to navigate effectively.
*   The map evolves based on player choices, potentially revealing hidden planes or closing off others.

### 3. **Reality Anchor System**
*   Players can create "reality anchors" - stable points that prevent convergence in small areas.
*   Anchors require personal sacrifices and create strategic gameplay around area control.
*   Powerful anchors can even reshape local reality, creating custom environments and challenges.
