**The Planar Convergence: Shattered Reality**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Reality itself is unraveling as the barriers between planes of existence begin to collapse, causing impossible phenomena to bleed into the material world. The players, initially drawn together by a shared vision of cosmic catastrophe, discover they are "Planar Anchors" - rare individuals who can stabilize reality tears and travel between dimensions. As they journey across increasingly unstable planes, they uncover an ancient entity that seeks to reshape existence according to its own design. The players must master the fundamental forces of reality itself while deciding whether to preserve the multiverse as it is or embrace the terrifying potential of total convergence.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the cosmology of the multiverse and the natural order that maintains separation between planes.
    *   Write the history of the Convergence Entity, from its origins as a mortal scholar to its ascension as a cosmic force.
    *   Describe the nature of reality tears and how they have evolved from minor phenomena to world-threatening catastrophes.
    *   Explain the role and abilities of Planar Anchors - individuals who can stabilize reality and travel between planes.
    *   Detail the various planar factions and their responses to the convergence crisis.
    *   Write about the "Convergence Prophecy" - ancient predictions about the event and its potential outcomes.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Anchorite Order** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To train Planar Anchors and prevent catastrophic convergence while studying the multiverse's secrets.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Council of experienced Anchors led by the most stable and knowledgeable members.
        *   **Public Agenda:** We protect reality from those who would reshape it for personal gain.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To harness convergence energy to explore previously inaccessible planes.
        *   **Assets:** Reality-stabilizing artifacts, network of safe houses across planes, ancient lore.
        *   **Relationships:** Allied with most planar factions; antagonistic toward the Convergence Entity's followers.
    *   **The Convergence Cult** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To accelerate the convergence and reshape reality according to their interpretation of the Entity's will.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Theocratic structure led by "Enlightened" individuals who claim direct communication with the Entity.
        *   **Public Agenda:** The convergence is evolution - resistance is ignorance.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To become the new architects of reality in the Entity's service.
        *   **Assets:** Reality-tearing artifacts, mind-altering substances, hidden convergence sites.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile toward all who resist convergence; seek to convert or eliminate Planar Anchors.
    *   **The Planar Merchants** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To profit from inter-planar trade while the barriers are weakened, establishing new trade routes.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Guild structure led by the most successful merchants with planar travel experience.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Convergence creates opportunities for those bold enough to seize them.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To establish monopolies on stable planar travel routes.
        *   **Assets:** Portable reality anchors, inter-planar caravans, black market convergence artifacts.
        *   **Relationships:** Neutral toward most factions; willing to trade with anyone regardless of ideology.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **The Convergence Weaver:** The ancient entity responsible for the convergence, appearing as shifting patterns of light and darkness.
    *   **Archmage Lirael Voss:** The brilliant wizard who serves as mentor to the players in planar magic.
    *   **The Reality Echo:** A version of one of the players from a converged timeline, serving as both ally and antagonist.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Planar Refugee"
    *   "Convergence Cultist"
    *   "Planar Merchant"
    *   "Reality-Stable Citizen"
    *   "Dimensional Explorer"
    *   "Convergence Prophet"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**

        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Floating thoughts, possibility strands), Sound (Whispering possibilities, echoing memories), Smell (Nothingness, potential).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully stabilize a major reality tear.
    *   **THEN:** Planar travel becomes easier in that region, creating new opportunities. Generate increased cult activity as they attempt to counter the players' efforts.
    *   **IF:** The players form an alliance with the Anchorite Order.
    *   **THEN:** They gain access to advanced planar magic and safe houses. Generate scenarios where the Order's conservative philosophy conflicts with player ambitions.
    *   **IF:** The players acquire a powerful convergence artifact.
    *   **THEN:** Their reality manipulation abilities increase dramatically. Generate cult hunters who seek to steal the artifact for their own purposes.
    *   **IF:** The players explore a previously inaccessible plane.
    *   **THEN:** They discover unique resources and allies. Generate reality instability that begins affecting their home plane.
    *   **IF:** The players confront the Convergence Entity directly.
    *   **THEN:** They gain cosmic insights but risk reality instability. Generate a scenario where the Entity attempts to convert rather than destroy them.
