# The Eldritch Slip

## Real-World Basis: The Philadelphia Experiment
An apocryphal naval military experiment from 1943. According to conspiracy theories, the U.S. Navy attempted to render the destroyer escort USS *Eldridge* invisible to enemy radar. The experiment went horribly wrong, causing the ship to become invisible, teleport to a new location, and then reappear, with some crew members gruesomely fused to the ship's structure, some driven insane, and others vanishing entirely.

## D&D Twist
A great magical empire of the past (think Netheril or a homebrew equivalent) was developing a new form of mass transit: the "Phase Sail," a spell that would shift a vessel through the Ethereal Plane to its destination instantaneously. During the maiden voyage of their flagship, "The Intrepid," the spell catastrophically failed. The ship didn't complete its journey; it was torn between planes, becoming permanently fused with the Ethereal Plane. It now drifts through the ethereal mists, a ghost ship caught in the moment of its own destruction, its crew a horrifying fusion of flesh, steel, and ethereal ectoplasm.

## Campaign Premise (Planar Horror/Survival)
The players are hired to salvage a rare artifact from a famous shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean. When they arrive at the coordinates, they find not their target, but a strange, shimmering fog bank from which the ghost ship emerges. They are drawn aboard by an unseen force and become trapped in the Ethereal Plane, tethered to the wreck of The Intrepid. The ship is a living dungeon where walls and floors phase in and out of existence, gravity is inconsistent, and the spectral crew (Phase Wraiths, Allips, and other ethereal undead) perceive the players as invaders in their eternal, misty hell. The players must navigate the spectral ship, piece together the story of its doomed crew from psychic echoes, and find a way to complete the failed teleportation spell to either bring the ship fully back to the Material Plane or escape its grasp before they, too, become a permanent part of the crew.

## Key Elements
*   **A Dungeon Adrift:** The ship is a self-contained, planar dungeon. Its layout is semi-stable, but certain areas are in constant flux. Doors might lead to different places each time they are opened, and the ship's deck opens into the endless, misty expanse of the Ethereal Plane.
*   **Ethereal Threats:** The main enemies are ethereal creatures and the spectral remnants of the crew. They can phase through walls, are resistant to normal weapons, and their attacks might drain Wisdom or Constitution rather than just hit points.
*   **The Mystery of the Spell:** The only way to escape is to understand what went wrong. Players will have to find the ship's spell-drive, gather the scattered notes of the archmage who designed it, and correctly re-calibrate the ritual—all while under constant assault.
*   **Trapped and Isolated:** The players are truly alone. There is no town to retreat to, no friendly NPCs to ask for help. Their survival depends entirely on their own resources and ingenuity.

## Tone
*Event Horizon* meets the Ethereal Plane from the D&D Player's Handbook. A claustrophobic, high-stakes survival horror adventure where the environment is as dangerous as the monsters.
