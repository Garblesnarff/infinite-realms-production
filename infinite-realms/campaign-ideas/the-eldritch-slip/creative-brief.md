## Logline
Based on the Philadelphia Experiment conspiracy, players are trapped aboard a legendary ghost ship that is permanently fused with the Ethereal Plane.

## Voice

A cold, ageless, gender-neutral voice, hollow and echoing, like a voice carried on the wind across a misty, spectral sea. The timbre is a subtle, distorted whisper, as if struggling to manifest from between realities. The pacing is slow and deliberate, each word drawn out with unnerving pauses, emphasizing the vast emptiness of the Ethereal Plane and the profound loneliness of a ship trapped between worlds. The emotion is a complete lack of human feeling, replaced by a sense of detached observation and the quiet horror of a magical disaster. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a pervasive, ambient static and the faint, distant sound of a ship's bell and creaking wood, emphasizing the ghostly nature of the vessel. Role: The voice of the ship's log, or the collective, psychic echo of the doomed crew.
