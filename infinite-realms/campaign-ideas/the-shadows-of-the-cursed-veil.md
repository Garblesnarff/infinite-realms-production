## Campaign Overview
- **Title**: Shadows of the Cursed Veil  
- **Campaign Type/Genre**: Dark Fantasy  
- **Estimated Length**: Short Campaign (6–8 sessions, assuming 3–4 hour sessions)  
- **Player Level Range**: Players start at level 3 and can reach level 7–8 by the end, with milestone leveling after key sessions to reflect story progress.  
- **Tone**: Gritty — emphasizing harsh realism, moral ambiguity, scarcity of resources, and consequences for failure, where heroism comes at a personal cost and trust is rare.  
- **Core Premise**: In a world shrouded by an eternal mist that corrupts the living, a ancient veil between realms has torn, unleashing shadowy horrors and undead legions upon the fractured kingdoms. The players, a band of outcasts drawn together by fate or desperation, discover they carry fragments of a forbidden artifact that could either seal the veil or unleash total oblivion. As they navigate alliances with dubious factions, they must confront their own inner demons while deciding if saving the world is worth the sacrifices demanded.  

## Story Arc
This short campaign is structured in three acts with clear escalation: Act 1 (Sessions 1–2) introduces the threat and hooks the players; Act 2 (Sessions 3–5) builds tension through alliances, betrayals, and deepening mysteries; Act 3 (Sessions 6–8) culminates in a high-stakes confrontation with branching resolutions based on player choices. The narrative emphasizes moral dilemmas, such as allying with a necromancer to fight a greater evil or sacrificing innocents for power, allowing multiple paths to victory or pyrrhic defeat. Pacing ramps up from survival-focused exploration to intense combats and revelations, ensuring players feel the world's grit through resource drains and lingering consequences like curses or injuries.

## Unique Mechanics
For Dark Fantasy (Gritty, Medium Difficulty): Introduce a **Corruption Track** (0–10 points) where exposure to the mist or artifact use adds points (e.g., +1 per failed save in corrupted areas). At thresholds (3/6/9), players gain minor flaws like disadvantage on certain checks or hallucinations, but can spend points for boons like shadow-based spells. Medium difficulty means encounters are balanced (CR matching party level) with puzzles requiring creative solutions, and survival elements like limited healing in mist zones encourage resource management without overwhelming lethality. Optional: **Moral Alignment Shifts** where key choices alter NPC reactions or unlock paths, tracked via a simple faction reputation system (+/-5 scale per group).
