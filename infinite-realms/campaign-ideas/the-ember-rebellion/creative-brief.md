# Creative Brief: The Ember Rebellion: Flames of Freedom

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Dark Fantasy Resistance (The Hunger Games meets Game of Thrones)

Inspired by the revolutionary fire of *The Hunger Games* and the political intrigue of *Game of Thrones*. This style aims to capture the oppressive atmosphere, desperate hope, and gritty determination of the Ember Rebellion, where medieval fantasy meets revolutionary warfare in a symphony of shadow and flame.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Oppressive Atmosphere:** Focus on the weight of Imperial occupation through environmental details and the contrast between oppressor luxury and rebel desperation.
*   **Revolutionary Spirit:** Highlight the spark of hope and determination in the face of overwhelming odds, showing both the beauty and terror of rebellion.
*   **Strategic Tension:** Use composition and lighting to convey the constant danger of resistance work and the thrill of successful operations.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Oppressive, hopeful, gritty, strategic, revolutionary, dark, inspiring.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of desperate determination and revolutionary fire. The atmosphere should evoke the thrill of resistance and the weight of oppression. The world feels both crushingly dark and inspiringly hopeful.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Strong, angular lines for Imperial architecture and machinery combined with fluid, dynamic lines for rebel movements and magical effects.
*   **Forms:** Imposing Imperial structures with intricate magical designs, rebels with practical but determined appearances, automatons that blend mechanical precision with dark magic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, atmospheric illustration in the style of The Hunger Games meets Game of Thrones, focusing on a rebel safe house hidden beneath an Imperial city where determined resistance fighters plan their next operation amid flickering candlelight and magical shadows."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dark, oppressive tones of black, deep red, and bruised purple accented by the bright orange of revolutionary fire and the cold blue of magical energy.
*   **Luminosity:** Dramatic lighting from magical sources, torchlight, and hidden rebel signals that creates contrast between darkness and hope.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...an oppressive color palette of deep blacks and bruised purples, accented by the bright orange of revolutionary flames and the cold blue glow of Imperial magic."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Practical rebel clothing - hooded cloaks, scavenged armor, hidden weapons - marked by the realistic wear of resistance life: dirt, scars, determined expressions.
*   **Imperial Elements:** Contrasting Imperial forces in elaborate uniforms with magical augmentations and soul-forged automatons.
*   **Expression:** Faces show the full range of resistance emotions - steely determination, quiet fear, revolutionary fire, exhausted hope.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A determined rebel fighter in a hooded cloak with hidden magical tattoos, wearing scavenged leather armor, their face showing revolutionary determination beneath scars from both battles and Imperial interrogations."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast fantasy landscapes with towering Imperial citadels, hidden rebel camps, and magical industrial complexes. Interiors feature secret meeting rooms, Imperial throne rooms, and guerrilla planning spaces.
*   **Atmosphere:** Always charged with revolutionary tension - distant sounds of Imperial patrols, the crackle of magical energy, the hushed sounds of conspiracy, the weight of constant danger.
*   **Details:** Resistance world-building - hidden messages in graffiti, makeshift magical devices, Imperial propaganda posters, memorials to fallen rebels.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dramatic view of the Black Citadel at midnight, with towering spires glowing with dark magic, rebel shadows moving through the streets below, the air charged with the tension of impending revolution."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting that emphasizes both the oppression and hope of the resistance. Light sources create realistic shadows on faces and atmospheric effects on magical phenomena.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, oppressive shadows that occasionally reveal hidden rebels or create visual metaphors for the weight of tyranny.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes both the darkness of Imperial rule and the light of revolutionary hope, with magical lighting creating terror and firelight creating moments of human connection.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the cold blue glow of Imperial magic, casting long shadows that hide rebel operatives and emphasizing the oppressive atmosphere of occupied Aerthos."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses revolutionary compositions with small rebel figures against vast Imperial structures and intimate close-ups for moments of quiet determination. Leading lines follow secret paths, sight lines, or revolutionary symbols.
*   **Techniques:** Rule of thirds placing rebels against massive Imperial backgrounds, dynamic angles for action sequences, symmetrical compositions for formal Imperial ceremonies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A revolutionary composition showing a secret rebel meeting in hidden catacombs, the composition using converging tunnel lines and determined figures to create a sense of building hope amid overwhelming oppression."
