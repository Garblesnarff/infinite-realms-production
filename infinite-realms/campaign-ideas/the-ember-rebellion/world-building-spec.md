*   **Content:** In the once-prosperous land of Aerthos, the tyrannical Obsidian Empire has established total dominance through dark arcane rituals and soul-forged automatons that crush all dissent. The players emerge as key members of a fledgling resistance movement, operating in the shadows to gather allies, sabotage Imperial operations, and ignite the flames of rebellion among the oppressed populace. As they navigate the treacherous world of espionage, guerrilla warfare, and political intrigue, they discover the horrifying truth behind the Empire's power source. The players must decide whether to fight for immediate survival, build a sustainable resistance movement, or risk everything in a desperate bid to dismantle the Empire's magical infrastructure at its core.
