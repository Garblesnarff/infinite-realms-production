## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Rebellion Morale & Imperial Scrutiny System**
*   Players track "Rebellion Morale" that increases with successful missions and grows the resistance movement.
*   The Empire has an "Imperial Scrutiny" score that increases with bold actions, leading to harsher crackdowns.
*   Players must balance these scores, choosing between bold, morale-boosting actions and subtle, low-risk operations.

### 2. **The Magic Resource System**
*   Magic is a finite resource in Aerthos, with the Empire hoarding it through dark rituals.
*   Players can acquire "Magic Points" through missions, representing stolen arcane energy.
*   Magic Points can be spent for powerful effects but risk corruption or detection by the Empire.

### 3. **The Network Web**
*   Players build a network of contacts, safe houses, and allies across Aerthos.
*   The network provides resources and information but requires maintenance and protection.
*   Network strength affects available missions, resources, and the rebellion's overall power.
