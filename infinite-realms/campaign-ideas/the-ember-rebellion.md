### Core Premise
The players are members of a fledgling resistance movement in the land of Aerthos, which has been brutally subjugated by the magically advanced, tyrannical Obsidian Empire. The Empire, powered by dark arcane rituals and soul-forged automatons, crushes all dissent. The players must operate in the shadows, gathering allies, sabotaging Imperial operations, and sparking the flames of rebellion among the oppressed populace. Their ultimate goal is to dismantle the Empire's magical infrastructure and restore freedom to Aerthos, even if it means facing overwhelming odds.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Seeds of Sedition (Sessions 1-4)**
- The players begin as small-time rebels, performing acts of defiance and sabotage against local Imperial garrisons. They must recruit new members, establish safe houses, and learn the Empire's weaknesses. They encounter the brutal efficiency of Imperial magic and the despair of the populace.

**Act 2: The Growing Flame (Sessions 5-10)**
- The rebellion gains momentum, attracting more followers and resources. The players undertake more ambitious missions: rescuing political prisoners, stealing Imperial schematics, or disrupting major magical rituals. They uncover the true, horrifying source of the Empire's power and the extent of its magical control.

**Act 3: Inferno of Freedom (Sessions 11-15)**
- The rebellion launches a full-scale assault against a key Imperial stronghold or a vital magical nexus. The players must lead the charge, facing the Empire's most powerful mages and automatons. The campaign culminates in a climactic battle that will either break the Empire's magical grip or see the rebellion crushed forever.

### Major NPCs

- **The Shadow Weaver (Rebel Leader)**: The enigmatic, masked leader of the overall rebellion. **Role**: Quest Giver / Strategist. **Personality**: Cunning, ruthless when necessary, but deeply committed to freedom. **Flaw/Secret**: They are a former Imperial mage who defected, and their identity is a closely guarded secret, fearing Imperial retribution.
- **General Valerius, the Iron Hand**: A brutal, magically augmented Imperial general. **Role**: Recurring Antagonist. **Personality**: Unyielding, efficient, and utterly loyal to the Empire. **Flaw/Secret**: He believes the Empire brings order and stability, and that the rebellion only brings chaos, making him a formidable and morally complex foe.
- **The Whispering Oracle**: An ancient, magically bound seer who provides cryptic prophecies and guidance to the rebellion. **Role**: Informant / Plot Device. **Personality**: Frail, speaks in riddles, and is often in pain from the visions. **Flaw/Secret**: The Oracle is slowly being consumed by the Empire's dark magic, and its prophecies are becoming increasingly distorted.

### Key Locations

- **The Black Citadel**: The imposing, magically warded capital of the Obsidian Empire, a symbol of its power and oppression.
- **The Whispering Woods**: A vast, ancient forest that serves as a haven for rebels and a source of natural magic, constantly patrolled by Imperial forces.
- **The Soul-Forge Factories**: Industrial complexes where the Empire creates its automatons, powered by the captured souls of its enemies.
- **The Hidden Enclave**: A secret, magically shielded base of the rebellion, constantly moving to avoid detection.

### Central Conflict
The fight for freedom against a technologically and magically superior oppressive regime. It's a story of hope, sacrifice, and the struggle to ignite a revolution against overwhelming odds.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Rebellion Morale & Imperial Scrutiny**: The rebellion has a "Morale Score" that increases with successful missions and acts of defiance, attracting more recruits and resources. However, the Empire has an "Imperial Scrutiny" score that increases with overt acts of rebellion, leading to harsher patrols, more magical surveillance, and increased difficulty for missions. Players must balance these two scores, choosing between bold, morale-boosting actions and subtle, low-profile operations. This creates a strategic layer where every action has consequences for the overall war effort, forcing players to think beyond individual encounters.
