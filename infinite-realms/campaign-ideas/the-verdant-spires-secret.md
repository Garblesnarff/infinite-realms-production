- **Tone**: Lush, Mysterious, Stratified, Urgent

### Core Premise
The world exists within the colossal, ancient tree-city of Yggdrasil, a living marvel that stretches miles into the sky. Society is stratified by elevation: the wealthy and powerful live in the sun-drenched upper canopies, while the poor and marginalized dwell in the perpetually shadowed roots and lower trunks. A mysterious blight begins to spread from the roots upwards, threatening the entire tree. The players, from various strata of Yggdrasil, must venture through its diverse biomes, uncover the source of the blight, and navigate the complex social and ecological challenges to save their home.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Roots of Discontent (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players, initially from different social strata, are brought together by a common threat: the blight affecting their respective communities. They must investigate the initial symptoms of the blight in the lower levels, encountering resistance from both the desperate inhabitants and the indifferent upper-canopy authorities.

**Act 2: The Ascending Sickness (Sessions 4-8)**
- As the blight spreads, its true nature becomes clearer – it's not just a disease, but a magical corruption. The players must ascend through Yggdrasil's middle levels, each a distinct biome with its own challenges and inhabitants, seeking ancient lore or a cure. They uncover evidence of a deeper conspiracy or an ancient ecological imbalance.

**Act 3: Heart of the Spire (Sessions 9-12)**
- The blight reaches the upper canopies, forcing the ruling elite to acknowledge the crisis. The players discover the true source of the blight, perhaps an ancient parasitic entity within the tree's core, a forgotten ritual gone awry, or a deliberate act of sabotage. They must confront this source at the very heart of Yggdrasil, making difficult choices that could reshape the tree-city's society forever.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Root Rot**: Players, perhaps a street urchin from the roots, a guard from the mid-trunk, and a scholar from the canopy, are brought together by a shared concern over the blight. They investigate its initial manifestations in the dark, damp root systems.
- **Session 2: Whispers in the Bark**: The blight causes strange mutations in the root-dwellers and local fauna. The players discover that the blight is not natural, but magical, and find a cryptic message from a forgotten druidic order.
- **Session 3: The Canopy's Indifference**: The players attempt to bring their findings to the attention of the upper-canopy authorities, facing bureaucratic hurdles and social prejudice. They might have to perform a daring act to get noticed.
- **Session 4-5: The Great Trunk Market**: Ascending to the mid-trunk, they navigate a bustling, diverse market where goods from all levels are traded. They seek a rare ingredient or a sage who might know more about the blight, encountering social tensions and potential sabotage.
- **Session 6-7: The Hanging Gardens**: They explore a section of the tree where the blight has caused beautiful but deadly overgrowth, creating a dangerous, shifting labyrinth. They find an ancient druidic shrine with a partial prophecy.
- **Session 8: The Sky-Bridge Sabotage**: As they approach the upper levels, a vital sky-bridge is sabotaged, threatening to cut off the lower levels. The players must repair it or find an alternative route, suspecting a faction is trying to isolate the problem.
- **Session 9-10: The Sun-Drenched Courts**: In the upper canopies, they confront the ruling council, who are now desperate. They discover the blight is linked to an ancient pact or a forgotten entity within Yggdrasil's core.
- **Session 11-12: The Heartwood Confrontation**: The players delve into the sacred Heartwood, the very core of Yggdrasil. They confront the source of the blight – be it a parasitic entity, a corrupted guardian, or a magical device – and make a choice that will determine the tree-city's future, potentially sacrificing themselves or reshaping society.

### Major NPCs

- **Elder Willow**: An ancient, wise treant who lives in the lower trunk. **Role**: Guide / Oracle. **Personality**: Patient, slow to speak, but deeply connected to Yggdrasil. **Flaw/Secret**: She is slowly being consumed by the blight herself and fears she will become part of the problem.
- **Lord Aerion**: A haughty, influential noble from the upper canopy. **Role**: Obstacle / Reluctant Ally. **Personality**: Arrogant, dismissive of lower-level concerns, but ultimately cares for Yggdrasil's survival (as it is his home). **Flaw/Secret**: His family's wealth is built on a secret, unsustainable harvesting practice that is contributing to the blight.
- **The Root-Speaker**: A charismatic leader of the root-dwellers. **Role**: Rebel Leader / Potential Antagonist. **Personality**: Passionate, fiery, believes the upper levels are to blame for the blight and seeks to overthrow them. **Flaw/Secret**: He is unknowingly being influenced by the blight itself, which whispers promises of power and vengeance.

### Key Locations

- **The Root-Warren**: A sprawling, subterranean network of tunnels and caverns, home to the poorest and most desperate.
- **The Bark-City**: The main trunk, a bustling, vertical metropolis with markets, workshops, and homes carved into the bark.
- **The Canopy Spires**: Elegant, airy structures built among the highest branches, bathed in perpetual sunlight, home to the elite.
- **The Heartwood Core**: The sacred, magical center of Yggdrasil, where the tree's life force pulses.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to save a living world from an ecological and magical blight, complicated by deep-seated social inequality and political maneuvering. It's a fight for survival that forces players to confront both external threats and internal prejudices.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Yggdrasil's Health & Social Standing**: The tree-city has a visible "Health" tracker, representing the blight's progression. As the blight worsens, new environmental hazards appear (e.g., falling branches, toxic spores, mutated creatures). Simultaneously, players have a "Social Standing" score within each of Yggdrasil's strata (Roots, Trunk, Canopy). Actions taken in one stratum (e.g., helping the poor in the roots) might increase standing there but decrease it in another (e.g., angering the nobles in the canopy). This forces players to make difficult choices about who to help and how to navigate the social landscape, as their access to resources and information depends on their reputation.
