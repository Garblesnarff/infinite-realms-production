### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Dreamscape Manifest**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The world should be whimsical, eerie, and operate on surreal dream-logic.
*   **Content:** In the world of Somnia, the collective dreams of its inhabitants manifest physically each night, altering the landscape. The players are "Dream Weavers," individuals who can navigate this ever-changing Dreamscape. When a powerful, collective nightmare threatens to become a permanent reality, they must enter the deepest layers of the dream to find its source and restore balance.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of the Dreamscape Manifest. Has it always been this way, or was it caused by a specific event?
    *   Write the history of the Dream Weavers. How are they identified and trained?
    *   Describe the nature of a "Dream Anchor" and its function in stabilizing reality.
    *   Explain the story of a previous collective nightmare and how it was overcome.
    *   Detail the legend of the Somnia Sage and their role in understanding the Dreamscape.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Dream Weavers (The Players)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To investigate dangerous manifestations, protect the innocent, and stop the collective nightmare.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A loose-knit group, possibly mentored by the Somnia Sage.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To act as guides and protectors within the Dreamscape.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To discover the true nature of the Nightmare Weaver and the cause of the spreading despair.
        *   **Assets:** The ability to manipulate dream-logic, knowledge of the Dreamscape, Psychic Resonances.

        *   **Hierarchy:** A single, powerful entity (the traumatized Prince Alaric) whose subconscious is the source of the nightmare.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. It is a force of unconscious despair.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To protect the Prince's mind from further pain by trapping everyone in his nightmare, so he never has to wake up.
        *   **Assets:** The ability to shape the Dreamscape, create powerful nightmare creatures (like the Bogeyman), and influence the emotions of dreamers.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonist, unknowingly hostile to all.
    *   **The Dream Thieves** (Minor)

        *   **Secret Agenda:** To collect the most potent dreams, regardless of the consequences for the dreamer.
        *   **Assets:** The ability to move unseen through the Dreamscape, knowledge of hidden paths, a market for stolen emotions.
        *   **Relationships:** A neutral, chaotic faction that can be an obstacle or a source of information for a price.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **The Somnia Sage, Master Elara:** The ancient, wise, and ethereal mentor to the Dream Weavers.
    *   **The Bogeyman:** A relentless and unkillable manifestation of collective fear that hunts the players.

    *   "Mischievous Dream Thief (Creature)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections. Emphasize the surreal and psychological nature of each location.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Marketplace of Anxiety:** The dream-manifestation of the city's marketplace, now a frantic, non-stop auction of memories and fears.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Auction Block of Regrets, the Stall of Lost Opportunities, the stall that sells bottled laughter, the fountain that weeps.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Dream-figures of merchants consumed by anxiety, emotion-brokers, the Bogeyman (when drawn by fear).
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** The buying and selling of abstract concepts (memories, ideas, emotions).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A player's minor fear manifests as a small, hostile creature; a merchant tries to sell a player a memory of their own childhood; the Bogeyman appears; a bidding war over a "happy memory" gets out of hand; the entire market suddenly changes its currency from gold to "seconds of your life."
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Nightmare Architect's first victim is here, endlessly reliving their greatest failure." "You can buy a key that unlocks any door, but the price is the memory of your first love." "The Bogeyman is afraid of genuine, selfless courage."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (A frantic, swirling crowd; goods that shimmer and change shape; colors that reflect the mood), Sound (The cacophony of a thousand auctioneers, whispers of insecurities), Smell (The scent of ozone from raw emotion, the smell of old regrets).
    *   **The Prince's Nightmare:** The heart of the dream, a twisted, gothic version of a royal nursery.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The giant, weeping rocking horse; the mobile of shattered planets; the crib surrounded by a fortress of pillows; the closet that contains a manifestation of the Prince's grief.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Monstrous, living toys; shadowy figures of disapproving adults; the terrified psychic projection of Prince Alaric.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This is the final dungeon.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A squad of toy soldiers attacks, a giant, crying teddy bear blocks the path, the room is plunged into darkness as the Prince hides, a player is tempted with a vision of their own deepest desire, the Prince's grief manifests as a powerful, sorrowful monster.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Prince is not in control of the nightmare; his grief is." "The key to reaching the Prince is a lullaby his mother used to sing." "The Bogeyman is the Prince's protector, not his creation."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Exaggerated, looming furniture; long, distorted shadows; monstrous toys), Sound (A distorted music box melody, a child's sobbing, the whispers of unseen things), Smell (Dust, tears, ozone).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player fails a Reality Check saving throw.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a minor, personal nightmare for that player. They are briefly separated from the party in a pocket dimension representing one of their own fears, and must overcome it to return.
    *   **IF:** The players use the "Impose Belief" mechanic to create a solution to a puzzle.
    *   **THEN:** The dreamscape adapts. The next puzzle they face will be designed by the Prince's subconscious to be resistant to that kind of logic, forcing the players to find new, creative solutions.
    *   **IF:** The players manage to temporarily defeat or evade the Bogeyman.
    *   **THEN:** The collective fear in that dream-region lessens, making the environment less hostile. However, the Bogeyman returns in the next region, now possessing a new ability based on how the players defeated it last time.
    *   **IF:** The players find and experience the Prince's happiest memory of his mother.
    *   **THEN:** They can use this Psychic Resonance as a weapon against nightmare creatures, or as a key to reach the Prince in the heart of his nightmare.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players choose to attack the psychic projection of Prince Alaric.
    *   **THEN:** The dreamscape itself turns violently against them. The Prince's grief manifests as a powerful, kaiju-sized monster, and the only way to win is to defeat this creature, which will cause permanent psychological damage to the Prince in the waking world.
