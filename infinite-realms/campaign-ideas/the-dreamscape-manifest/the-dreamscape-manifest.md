- **Player Level Range**: 3-10

### Core Premise
In the world of Somnia, the line between dream and reality is blurred. Every night, the collective dreams of its inhabitants manifest physically, shaping the landscape, creating ephemeral creatures, and altering the very laws of nature. These "Dream Manifests" can be beautiful, terrifying, or utterly absurd. The players are "Dream Weavers" – individuals attuned to this phenomenon, tasked with navigating the ever-changing Dreamscape, investigating strange manifestations, and preventing nightmares from becoming permanent realities. When a powerful, collective nightmare threatens to consume Somnia, they must delve into the deepest layers of the Dreamscape to find its source and restore the balance between waking and dreaming.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Waking Dream (Sessions 1-3)**
- The campaign begins as the players experience the everyday wonders and dangers of Somnia's Dream Manifests. They take on minor cases: a child's imaginary friend coming to life, a recurring nightmare causing localized chaos, or a beautiful dream-garden needing cultivation. They learn to interpret dream-logic and manipulate the ephemeral reality.

**Act 2: The Nightmare's Embrace (Sessions 4-8)**
- A powerful, collective nightmare begins to spread, manifesting as terrifying creatures, oppressive landscapes, and a growing sense of despair. The players discover that this nightmare is not random, but is being fueled or directed by a malevolent entity, a powerful dream-mage, or a forgotten trauma that is manifesting physically. They seek ancient dream-lore or a legendary "Dream Anchor" that can stabilize reality.

**Act 3: The Dawn of Reality (Sessions 9-12)**
- The collective nightmare reaches a critical mass, threatening to permanently alter Somnia into a realm of eternal terror. The players locate the source of the nightmare – perhaps a slumbering entity, a powerful artifact, or a deeply traumatized individual. They must confront this source within the heart of the Dreamscape, using their understanding of dream-logic and their own inner strength to dispel the nightmare and restore the balance.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Imaginary Friend**: A child's imaginary friend has manifested physically and is causing minor mischief in a village. The players must find a way to gently un-manifest it without causing the child distress. Introduction to the "Dream-Logic Manipulation" mechanic.
- **Session 2: The Recurring Nightmare**: A local inn is plagued by a recurring nightmare that manifests as a terrifying monster each night. The players must enter the dream of the innkeeper to understand and dispel the nightmare.
- **Session 3: The Dream-Garden Heist**: A beautiful dream-garden, filled with ephemeral flora and fauna, is being plundered by a group of "Dream Poachers" who sell its unique manifestations. The players must stop them and protect the garden.
- **Session 4-5: The Spreading Despair**: A powerful, collective nightmare begins to manifest, creating zones of fear and despair. The players must venture into these zones, encountering terrifying dream-creatures and struggling against the psychological influence of the nightmare.
- **Session 6-7: The Dream Anchor**: They seek an ancient artifact or a legendary location known as a "Dream Anchor," which can stabilize reality. This might lead them to a forgotten temple or a reclusive dream-sage.
- **Session 8: The Dream-Mage's Lair**: The players discover that a powerful dream-mage is either fueling the nightmare or trying to control it for their own purposes. They must infiltrate their hidden lair, which exists in a constantly shifting dream-space.
- **Session 9-10: The Heart of the Nightmare**: The players locate the source of the collective nightmare – perhaps a slumbering entity, a powerful artifact, or a deeply traumatized individual whose pain is manifesting physically.
- **Session 11-12: The Grand Awakening**: A climactic confrontation within the heart of the Dreamscape. The players must use their understanding of dream-logic, their own inner strength, and perhaps the Dream Anchor to dispel the nightmare, confront the entity, or heal the traumatized individual. The campaign ends with the restoration of balance and the players as legendary Dream Weavers.

### Major NPCs

- **The Somnia Sage, Master Elara**: An ancient, wise Dream Weaver who guides the players. **Role**: Mentor / Informant. **Personality**: Calm, ethereal, and speaks in metaphors. **Flaw/Secret**: She is constantly battling her own nightmares, and her connection to the Dreamscape is both a blessing and a curse.
- **The Nightmare Weaver (Antagonist)**: The entity or individual fueling the collective nightmare. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Varies (e.g., a malevolent entity, a traumatized individual, a power-hungry dream-mage). **Flaw/Secret**: Their motivations are often rooted in deep-seated fear, pain, or a desire for control, making them complex adversaries.
- **The Dream Thief, "Whisper"**: A mischievous, chaotic entity that steals pleasant dreams and replaces them with minor anxieties. **Role**: Recurring Nuisance / Ambiguous Ally. **Personality**: Playful, unpredictable, and enjoys causing minor chaos. **Flaw/Secret**: It is a manifestation of collective anxiety and can be reasoned with or bribed with pleasant dreams.

### Key Locations

- **The Shifting City of Somnia**: The central hub, where buildings and streets subtly change based on the collective mood of its inhabitants.
- **The Whispering Woods**: A forest where trees grow from forgotten memories, and paths lead to strange, ephemeral places.
- **The Nightmare Peaks**: A mountain range where the collective nightmares manifest as terrifying creatures and oppressive landscapes.
- **The Dream Anchor**: A legendary artifact or a natural formation that stabilizes the Dreamscape, a beacon of reality.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to maintain the delicate balance between dream and reality, preventing nightmares from consuming the waking world. It's a quest for understanding the power of the subconscious and the fight against the forces that seek to exploit or destroy it.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Dream-Logic Manipulation & Reality Checks**: Players can attempt to manipulate the Dreamscape using their imagination and Charisma (Persuasion/Deception) or Intelligence (Arcana) checks. Success allows them to alter minor aspects of reality (e.g., making a door appear, changing the color of a wall, convincing a dream-creature it's a friendly pet). However, pushing dream-logic too far or failing a check can trigger a "Reality Check" – a Wisdom saving throw. Failure on a Reality Check can cause temporary disorientation, psychic damage, or even manifest a minor nightmare. This encourages creative problem-solving and roleplaying within the surreal environment, but also reminds players of the inherent dangers of a fluid reality.
