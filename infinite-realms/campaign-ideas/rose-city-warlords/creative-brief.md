# Creative Brief: Rose City Warlords

## Logline

In a quarantined Portland transformed by an accidentally detonated 1970s "gay bomb," players must unite absurdly fierce warrior clans—based on hipsters, baristas, and cyclists—to fight off the shadowy government agency that created them and now wants to erase its mistake.

## Genre

Gritty, Humorous, Satirical Post-Apocalyptic Action

## Key Features

*   **Unique Premise:** A high-concept, unforgettable world that blends real-world conspiracy theories with sharp social satire.
*   **Faction-Based Gameplay:** Navigate the hilarious and dangerous politics of warring clans based on Portland stereotypes (The Handlebar Host, The Caffeine Cult, The Chain-Gang).
*   **High-Octane, Gritty Combat:** Engage in brutal, stylish combat where artisanal axes meet salvaged drone technology.
*   **A World of Contrasts:** Explore a city that is simultaneously a brutal post-apocalyptic wasteland and a vibrant hub of flamboyant self-expression.

## Target Audience

Fans of the *Fallout* or *Borderlands* series, who enjoy satirical world-building and faction-based RPGs. Players who appreciate the gritty, campy action of films like *Escape from New York* or *The Warriors*, but with a modern, humorous twist.

## Voice

A young, energetic, gender-neutral voice, with a slightly raspy, excited, and sarcastic tone, like a renegade radio DJ broadcasting from a hidden bunker. Their standard American accent is infused with the manic energy of a city gone wild, with a fast and frenetic pacing that shifts with the chaos of the streets. The emotion is a blend of cynical humor, rebellious energy, and a touch of manic glee. Audio quality is raw, slightly distorted, with a 'pirate radio' feel, punctuated by bursts of static and the faint, distant sounds of urban warfare. Role: The voice of the Rose City underground, or a commentator on the absurdities of the Warlords' reign.
