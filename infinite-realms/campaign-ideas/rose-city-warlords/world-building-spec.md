**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In a quarantined Portland transformed by an accidentally detonated 1970s "gay bomb," players must unite absurdly fierce warrior clans—based on hipsters, baristas, and cyclists—to fight off Project Chimera, the shadowy government agency that created them and now wants to erase its mistake. The discovery of a crashed government drone reveals Chimera's plan to "sanitize" the Portland Exclusion Zone (PEZ), forcing the players to broker a truce between the warring clans.

**2. Lore & History Primer**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully unite two or more clans.
    *   **THEN:** Project Chimera escalates its tactics, viewing the alliance as a major threat. Generate a mission where Chimera attempts to assassinate a clan leader to shatter the new alliance.
    *   **IF:** The players fail to win the respect of a major clan.
    *   **THEN:** That clan refuses to help in the final battle. Worse, Project Chimera may exploit the division, bribing or manipulating the clan into fighting against the players.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully retrieve the data from the crashed Chimera drone.
    *   **THEN:** They learn the specific nature of Chimera's plan (e.g., the chemical formula for the "antidote" or the location of their primary staging ground), giving them a clear next objective.
    *   **IF:** The players delve into the original 1979 lab and find a way to amplify Agent Lavender.
    *   **THEN:** They can choose to deploy it. Generate the consequences: the clans become even more fiercely effective warriors, but also more aggressive and harder to control, potentially leading to a pyrrhic victory.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully broadcast the truth about Project Chimera to the outside world.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the national guard stands down, but the PEZ is now a global curiosity, facing a new invasion of journalists, tourists, and corporations, creating a whole new set of problems.
