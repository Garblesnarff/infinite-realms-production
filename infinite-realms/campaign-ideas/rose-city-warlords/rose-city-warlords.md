# Rose City Warlords

## Concept

In 1979, a top-secret, non-lethal chemical weapon known as "Agent Lavender" was accidentally detonated over Portland, Oregon. The weapon, designed to foster intense camaraderie and attraction to disrupt enemy formations, had an unforeseen side effect. It didn't just make people "gay"; it unlocked a latent, primal warrior ethos genetically linked to historical warrior societies like the Sacred Band of Thebes. The result: Portland became a quarantined city-state of fiercely effective, fabulously dressed warrior clans. Now, decades later, the city is a bizarre and brutal urban jungle where battles are fought over artisanal coffee roasters, fixed-gear bike supply lines, and control of the bridges that connect the Portland Exclusion Zone (PEZ) to the outside world.

## The Hook

The player characters are a crew of up-and-comers in the PEZ, trying to carve out a name for themselves. They could be members of an existing clan or independents. The campaign kicks off when they discover evidence of a new, outside threat. A high-tech drone, unlike any local tech, crashes in their territory. Its data logs reveal that "Project Chimera," the shadowy government agency that created Agent Lavender, is preparing to move on Portland. Their goal: to reclaim their "assets," either by capturing the populace for weaponization, deploying a so-called "antidote," or wiping the entire experiment off the map. The PCs are the only ones who know the truth, and they must unite the absurd, warring factions of the Rose City before they are all "sanitized."

## The World: The Portland Exclusion Zone (PEZ)

The PEZ is a mix of urban decay and vibrant, chaotic reconstruction. The US government maintains a hard quarantine, with the Willamette and Columbia rivers acting as natural moats. The bridges are the only way in or out, heavily fortified and controlled by the most powerful clans. Within the city, life is a blend of gritty survival and flamboyant expression. Power is generated by salvaged hydro-dams and solar arrays. Food is grown in vast urban farms. And the old mantra of "Keep Portland Weird" has become a sacred law, enforced with the edge of a blade.

## Major Factions & Clans

The clans of the PEZ are a satirical reflection of old Portland stereotypes, now hardened into deadly warrior societies.

*   **The Handlebar Host:** Obsessed with pre-bomb aesthetics, they are master artisans of war. They fight with bespoke, handcrafted axes and meticulously maintained vintage firearms. Their armor is a mix of salvaged metal and waxed canvas. They control the Pearl District, known for its forges and workshops.
*   **The Caffeine Cult:** These berserkers control the city's coffee supply. Using a potent cold-brew concoction, they can enter a state of heightened speed and frenzy in battle. They are territorial, erratic, and worship a mythical figure known as "The First Roaster." Their territory is centered around the old Stumptown roasting facilities.
*   **The Chain-Gang:** Masters of urban mobility and hit-and-run tactics, the Chain-Gang are elite cyclists. They wield hooked chains, modified bike frames, and crossbows, using the city's bike lanes for lightning-fast raids. They control the major bike routes and the Hawthorne Bridge.
*   **The Silicon Sentinels:** A clan of former tech-bros who have repurposed old server farms and tech campuses into a fortress. They use combat drones, hacked infrastructure, and experimental energy weapons. They are logical, aloof, and believe they can "optimize" the city through force. They hold the "Silicon Forest" west of the city.
*   **The Veridian Guard:** Radical environmentalists turned eco-terrorists, the Guard uses guerrilla warfare tactics. They have cultivated weaponized flora in Forest Park and can call upon mutated beasts. They see Agent Lavender as a "purification" of humanity and violently resist any influence from the outside world.

## Antagonists: Project Chimera

The remnants of the DARPA-esque program that created Agent Lavender. They are cold, clinical, and utterly ruthless.
*   **Goal:** To rectify their "mistake." The hardliners want to deploy a chemical agent that will sterilize the PEZ. The "research" faction wants to capture Portlanders to study and replicate the warrior effect, creating a new super-soldier program.
*   **Methods:** They operate from a secret base outside the quarantine zone. They use elite soldiers with cutting-edge tech, infiltrator agents disguised as scavengers, and psychological warfare to turn the clans against each other.

## Campaign Arcs

1.  **A-Uniting the Clans:** The PCs must navigate the treacherous and hilarious politics of the PEZ. This involves completing quests for the various clan leaders: retrieving a legendary espresso machine for the Caffeine Cult, winning a fixed-gear death-race for the Chain-Gang, or recovering lost schematics for the Silicon Sentinels. Each success earns them respect and a potential ally.
2.  **The Chimera Offensive:** Project Chimera makes its first major move, launching a full-scale assault on one of the bridges (e.g., the St. Johns Bridge). The PCs must rally the clans they've befriended into a unified fighting force to repel the invasion in a massive, set-piece battle.
3.  **The Heart of the Lavender:** To turn the tide, the PCs need to learn more about Agent Lavender. They must lead a delve into the ruins of the original 1979 detonation site—a sealed government lab deep beneath Pioneer Courthouse Square. Inside, they might find the original chemical formula, research on its weaknesses, or even a way to amplify its warrior-making effects.
4.  **Break the Quarantine:** Armed with the knowledge from the lab, the PCs lead a unified army of Portlanders in a final, desperate assault to break the quarantine. Their goal is to capture a Chimera communications hub and broadcast the truth of the PEZ and Project Chimera to the entire world, ensuring their city's survival through exposure.

## Themes

*   **Found Family & Identity:** The clans are built on intense loyalty and camaraderie.
*   **Rebellion vs. Conformity:** The fight against the sterile, uniform world of Project Chimera.
*   **Grit & Glamour:** The juxtaposition of brutal survival and fabulous self-expression.
*   **Satire:** A humorous critique of modern tribalism and stereotypes.
