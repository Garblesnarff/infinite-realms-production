- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Scholarly Fantasy / Exploration / Mystery
- **Estimated Length**: 10-12 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 3-10
- **Tone**: Curious, Intellectual, Mysterious, Dangerous

### Core Premise
The players live in the city of Librarium, a sprawling metropolis built entirely within a colossal, ancient library known as the "Infinite Archive." Here, books are not just sources of knowledge; they are buildings, bridges, and even entire districts. Knowledge is power, and the various factions of Librarium (scribes, librarians, scholars, and even book-thieves) vie for control over rare tomes and forgotten lore. When a section of the Archive begins to "unwrite" itself, causing entire districts to vanish and knowledge to be lost, the players must delve into the Archive's deepest, most dangerous sections to uncover the source of this existential threat and prevent their world from being erased.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Unraveling Pages (Sessions 1-3)**
- The campaign begins as minor sections of the Archive begin to unwrite themselves, causing confusion and fear. The players, as scholars, librarians, or even book-thieves, are tasked with investigating these anomalies. They learn about the Archive's unique ecosystem and the dangers of lost knowledge.

**Act 2: The Forbidden Chapters (Sessions 4-8)**
- As the unwriting spreads, the players discover that it is not a natural phenomenon, but a deliberate act or the consequence of a forbidden ritual. They must venture into the Archive's restricted sections, the "Forbidden Chapters," where dangerous knowledge and powerful entities reside. They encounter factions who seek to accelerate the unwriting or exploit the chaos for their own gain.

**Act 3: The Final Edit (Sessions 9-12)**
- The players locate the source of the unwriting – perhaps a rogue Arch-Librarian, an ancient entity that feeds on knowledge, or a forgotten magical device. They must confront this threat at the heart of the Archive, using their wits, their knowledge, and their understanding of the Archive's unique magic to prevent their world from being erased. The campaign culminates in a climactic battle of knowledge against oblivion.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Missing Shelf**: A section of the Archive, perhaps a street or a small building, has vanished overnight, its contents unwritten. The players are tasked with investigating, finding strange, blank pages or fragmented memories of what was there.
- **Session 2: The Whispering Scrolls**: They discover that some books are actively resisting the unwriting, their pages whispering forgotten lore or warnings. The players must decipher these messages, learning about the Archive's history.
- **Session 3: The Book-Thieves' Guild**: The players encounter a guild of book-thieves who are exploiting the chaos, stealing valuable tomes before they can be unwritten. The players might have to work with them or against them.
- **Session 4-5: The Restricted Section**: The unwriting spreads to a more vital section of Librarium. The players must gain access to the Archive's restricted sections, facing magical wards and vigilant guardians, to find a clue about the unwriting's source.
- **Session 6-7: The Living Codex**: They discover a legendary "Living Codex" – a sentient book that contains the Archive's true history. It is either being targeted by the unwriting or holds the key to stopping it.
- **Session 8: The Unwritten Ones**: The players encounter individuals who have been partially unwritten, their memories fragmented, their bodies fading. They learn about the horrifying consequences of the unwriting.
- **Session 9-10: The Arch-Librarian's Secret**: The players uncover evidence that a high-ranking Arch-Librarian is either responsible for the unwriting or is trying to control it for their own purposes.
- **Session 11-12: The Final Chapter**: A climactic confrontation with the source of the unwriting. The players must use their knowledge, their magical abilities, and their understanding of the Archive's unique magic to prevent their world from being erased. The campaign ends with the Archive restored, or a new, more fragile reality.

### Major NPCs

- **Arch-Librarian Valerius**: The ancient, wise, but increasingly desperate head of Librarium. **Role**: Quest Giver / Authority Figure. **Personality**: Calm, scholarly, but deeply burdened by the threat to the Archive. **Flaw/Secret**: He is slowly losing his own memories to the unwriting, making his guidance unreliable.
- **The Scribe-Lord, Kaelen**: The charismatic leader of a faction that believes the unwriting is a natural cleansing and seeks to accelerate it. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Fanatical, eloquent, and believes that only essential knowledge should remain. **Flaw/Secret**: He is secretly trying to unwrite a traumatic event from his own past, believing it will bring peace.
- **The Book-Worm, Fizzwick**: A small, mischievous creature that lives within the Archive, feeding on forgotten knowledge. **Role**: Informant / Comic Relief. **Personality**: Playful, curious, and knows every secret passage and hidden nook. **Flaw/Secret**: It is terrified of the unwriting, as it threatens its food source, and will help the players for a price (usually a rare, forgotten fact).

### Key Locations

- **The Grand Reading Room**: A colossal chamber where scholars study, its walls lined with books that stretch into the infinite.
- **The Restricted Stacks**: Sections of the Archive where dangerous or forbidden knowledge is kept, guarded by magical wards and constructs.
- **The Unwritten Zones**: Areas where the Archive has already been erased, leaving behind blank spaces and fragmented memories.
- **The Heart of the Archive**: The central core of Librarium, where the Archive's magic originates, and where the unwriting is most potent.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to preserve knowledge and reality in a world where both are literally being erased. It's a quest for truth, understanding, and the fight against oblivion, with the very existence of their world at stake.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Knowledge as Power & Unwriting Effects**: Players gain "Knowledge Points" by successfully researching, deciphering ancient texts, or recovering lost lore. These points can be spent to gain temporary skill proficiencies, learn new spells, or gain crucial insights into puzzles. However, as the unwriting spreads, players can suffer from "Unwriting Effects." These might include temporary memory loss (losing access to certain skills or spells), objects in their inventory vanishing, or even parts of their own backstory becoming fragmented. This mechanic emphasizes the fragility of knowledge and the constant threat of erasure, forcing players to prioritize what they learn and remember.
