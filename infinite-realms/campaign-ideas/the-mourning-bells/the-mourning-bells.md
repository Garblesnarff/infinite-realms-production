## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Madness Track**
*   Players accumulate "Madness Points" through exposure to supernatural events and personal hauntings.
*   Madness Points create psychological effects like hallucinations, paranoia, or temporary ability enhancements at the cost of mental stability.
*   Players can spend Madness Points for supernatural abilities or insight, but risk permanent psychological damage.

### 2. **The Haunting Deck**
*   A deck of cards representing different types of supernatural manifestations, from helpful spirit guidance to terrifying psychological attacks.
*   Players draw from this deck during rest periods or when investigating particularly cursed locations.
*   The deck evolves based on player actions, with successful spirit communications potentially removing harmful cards while failures add more dangerous ones.

### 3. **Spirit Communication**
*   Players can attempt to communicate with spirits through séances, automatic writing, or other occult methods.
*   Successful communications provide cryptic clues but risk attracting hostile spirits or increasing personal hauntings.
*   Failed attempts result in supernatural backlash, from poltergeist activity to possession attempts.
