**The Mourning Bells: Whispers from the Grave**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the fog-shrouded village of Ravenshollow, the dead refuse to rest peacefully, their graves disturbed by an ancient curse that grows stronger with each passing night. The players arrive as investigators, scholars, or desperate relatives, only to discover that the village's dark secret runs deeper than mere superstition. As spectral bells toll from empty church towers and ghostly apparitions wander moonlit streets, the players must unravel a generations-old tragedy of betrayal, murder, and forbidden love. But as they delve deeper into Ravenshollow's shadowed history, they risk becoming the curse's next victims, their own buried secrets rising to haunt them.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

    *   Write the history of the Blackwood family, whose forbidden love and tragic murder spawned the supernatural disturbances.
    *   Describe the nature of the Mourning Bells curse - is it a conscious entity, a psychic imprint, or something more supernatural?
    *   Explain how the curse has evolved over generations and why it has resisted numerous attempts at exorcism.
    *   Detail the various outsiders who have attempted to study or end the haunting and their ultimate fates.
    *   Write about the "Bellmarked" - individuals who have been touched by the curse and the psychological gifts and curses that come with it.
