# Creative Brief: The Mourning Bells: Whispers from the Grave

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Victorian Gothic Horror (Darkest Dungeon-inspired)

Inspired by the oppressive gothic horror and psychological depth of the *Darkest Dungeon* video game series. This style aims to capture the tragic beauty, creeping dread, and psychological torment of Ravenshollow, where Victorian elegance meets supernatural horror in a symphony of shadows and sorrow.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Psychological Depth:** Focus on facial expressions, body language, and environmental details that convey inner turmoil and creeping madness.
*   **Blend Elegance and Decay:** Highlight the tragic beauty of Victorian architecture and fashion corrupted by supernatural decay and psychological horror.
*   **Atmospheric Lighting:** Use dramatic lighting and shadow play to create isolation, mystery, and a sense of inevitable psychological decline.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Dark, atmospheric, psychological, tragic, oppressive, melancholic, Victorian, supernatural.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of inevitable tragedy and psychological torment. The atmosphere should evoke isolation and creeping dread, where beauty and horror are tragically intertwined. The world feels trapped in eternal twilight, with moments of heartbreaking beauty amid the decay.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and highly detailed, with flowing, organic lines for fabric and natural elements contrasted by sharp, jagged lines for supernatural manifestations and architectural details.
*   **Forms:** Characters are depicted with period-appropriate Victorian proportions but showing signs of psychological wear - hollow cheeks, shadowed eyes, trembling hands. Environments blend elegant architecture with creeping decay.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Darkest Dungeon. The focus is on a Victorian-era investigator, their face gaunt and eyes shadowed with creeping madness, standing before a fog-shrouded Gothic manor."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by deep grays, bruised purples, and faded blacks, accented by cold blues and the occasional flash of blood red. Flesh tones have an unhealthy pallor, like Victorian death portraits.
*   **Luminosity:** Strategic use of cold, spectral light sources (moonlight through stained glass, candle flames, ghostly glows) that cast long, dramatic shadows and create stark contrasts.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a somber color palette of deep grays and bruised purples, illuminated by cold moonlight filtering through cracked stained glass windows."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Victorian-era clothing with authentic period details - high collars, layered skirts, tailored coats - but showing signs of neglect and psychological strain. NPCs range from seemingly normal villagers to horrifying spectral manifestations.
*   **Spectral Entities:** Beautiful but terrifying ghosts in flowing Victorian dresses or formal wear, their forms distorted by rage or sorrow, with elongated limbs and hollow eyes.
*   **Expression:** Faces show the progression of psychological horror - from determined resolve to haunted despair to complete madness.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A spectral woman in a tattered Victorian wedding dress, her beautiful features twisted by rage and sorrow, eyes like bottomless wells of darkness, floating through a moonlit graveyard."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Oppressive Victorian Gothic architecture with grand manors, misty graveyards, and fog-shrouded village streets. Interiors feature elaborate but decaying Victorian furnishings, hidden passages, and supernatural manifestations.
*   **Atmosphere:** Heavy use of fog, mist, and atmospheric haze to create isolation and mystery. Weather is eternally overcast, with rain-slicked cobblestones and dripping architecture.
*   **Details:** Subtle horror elements - graves that appear freshly disturbed, mirrors that reflect different scenes, bells that move without being touched, portraits with eyes that seem to follow.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of Ravenshollow village at midnight, Gothic church spires piercing the fog, gravestones scattered like broken teeth across misty hills, spectral lights flickering in the distance."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with extreme contrasts between cold light and deep shadows. Light sources are often supernatural or create unnatural shadows that seem to have a life of their own.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, oppressive shadows that seem to move and pulse, suggesting hidden horrors and psychological torment. Rim lighting on characters creates stark silhouettes against misty backgrounds.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting conveys psychological states - cold moonlight for moments of revelation, flickering candlelight for intimate horror, complete darkness for psychological breaking points.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by cold moonlight filtering through stained glass, casting elongated shadows that twist like living entities across the stone floor, emphasizing the oppressive psychological atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses tight, claustrophobic framing for intimate horror scenes and wide, oppressive shots for environmental scale. Leading lines follow architectural features, sightlines, or supernatural manifestations.
*   **Techniques:** Rule of thirds placing characters against vast architectural backgrounds. Dutch angles for disorientation, symmetrical compositions for formal tragedy scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, oppressive shot of the Ravenshollow graveyard, the composition using twisted grave markers and Gothic architecture to create leading lines that draw the eye to a solitary figure standing amid the mist."

## Voice

A deep, resonant voice with the gravitas of a Victorian-era undertaker who has seen too many tragic deaths. The narrator's refined British accent carries the weight of generations of sorrow, with measured pacing that builds tension through pregnant pauses and whispered revelations. The emotion is one of tragic resignation and quiet horror, as if recounting an inevitable tragedy that cannot be prevented. Audio quality features subtle environmental ambience - distant tolling bells, creaking floorboards, the whisper of silk on stone, the faint echo of something weeping in the distance. Role: The voice of fate's chronicler, or the reluctant witness to humanity's descent into psychological darkness.
