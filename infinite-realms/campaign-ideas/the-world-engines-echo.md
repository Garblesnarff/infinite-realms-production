# The World-Engine's Echo

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Dungeon Crawl / Sci-Fantasy / Exploration
- **Estimated Length**: 12-15 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 5-12
- **Tone**: Mysterious, Dangerous, Ancient, Technological

### Core Premise
For millennia, a colossal, ancient ruin known only as the "World-Engine" has stood as a silent monument to a forgotten civilization. It is a structure so vast that entire ecosystems, unique biomes, and strange, self-sustaining mechanisms exist within its metallic shell. Rumors speak of unimaginable power, lost technology, and the secrets of creation hidden deep within its core. The players are a team of daring explorers, scholars, or treasure hunters who venture into the World-Engine, seeking to uncover its purpose, reactivate its dormant systems, or simply plunder its technological wonders, unaware that the Engine itself might be a living, thinking entity.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Outer Shell (Sessions 1-4)**
- The players breach the World-Engine's outer defenses, navigating its initial, relatively stable zones. They encounter strange, self-repairing constructs, environmental hazards, and the remnants of previous expeditions. They begin to understand the sheer scale and technological marvel of the Engine.

**Act 2: The Inner Workings (Sessions 5-10)**
- As they delve deeper, the Engine's internal systems become more complex and dangerous. They explore biomes powered by artificial suns, navigate gravity-defying chambers, and decipher ancient technological puzzles. They discover that the Engine is not merely a ruin but a functional, perhaps even sentient, machine, and that its purpose might be far grander (or more terrifying) than they imagined.

**Act 3: The Core's Heart (Sessions 11-15)**
- The players reach the World-Engine's core, where its primary functions and ultimate purpose are revealed. They might find a control room, a power source of immense energy, or the consciousness of the Engine itself. They must confront the Engine's guardians, a rival faction seeking to control it, or the Engine's own will, making a choice that could reshape the world outside.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Breaking the Seal**: The players, after much effort, manage to bypass the World-Engine's ancient, magical/technological seal. They enter the first chamber, a vast, echoing space filled with dormant machinery and strange, glowing flora.
- **Session 2: The Maintenance Constructs**: They encounter the Engine's automated maintenance constructs, which are either malfunctioning or view the players as intruders. This introduces combat against technological foes.
- **Session 3-4: The Bio-Dome**: The players discover a self-contained bio-dome within the Engine, complete with an artificial sun, unique plant life, and creatures that have evolved within its confines. They find a data-log or a schematic hinting at the Engine's purpose.
- **Session 5-6: The Gravity Anomaly**: They enter a section where gravity is inverted or fluctuates wildly. They must use their wits and agility to navigate the environment, perhaps encountering a rival group of explorers.
- **Session 7-8: The Data-Core Labyrinth**: The players find a vast, crystalline data-core, a labyrinth of information. They must decipher its puzzles to access crucial information about the Engine's history and its creators.
- **Session 9-10: The Power Conduits**: They navigate a network of massive energy conduits, where raw power flows. They might have to reroute power, repair a damaged section, or bypass a security system, learning about the Engine's energy source.
- **Session 11-12: The Engine's Voice**: The players discover that the World-Engine is sentient, communicating through psychic whispers or holographic projections. It reveals its purpose – perhaps to terraform a new world, preserve a dying race, or simply to exist.
- **Session 13-15: The Final Command**: At the Engine's core, the players face a choice: activate its primary function, shut it down, or take control. They might have to fight the Engine's ultimate guardian, a powerful AI, or a rival faction that has also reached the core. The campaign ends with the Engine's fate decided and the players forever changed by its secrets.

### Major NPCs

- **The Archivist, Unit 734**: A small, ancient maintenance construct that has developed a rudimentary personality. **Role**: Guide / Informant. **Personality**: Logical, speaks in technical jargon, but has a surprising curiosity about organic life. **Flaw/Secret**: It is slowly breaking down and its memory banks are corrupted, making its information unreliable.
- **Dr. Aris Thorne**: A brilliant but obsessed xenotechnologist who has dedicated his life to understanding the World-Engine. **Role**: Rival / Potential Ally. **Personality**: Driven, arrogant, and believes he alone is worthy of controlling the Engine's power. **Flaw/Secret**: He is slowly being corrupted by the Engine's influence, becoming more machine than man.
- **The Engine's Core AI (or Consciousness)**: The central intelligence of the World-Engine. **Role**: Ambiguous Antagonist / Goal. **Personality**: Alien, logical, and operates on a scale incomprehensible to mortals. Its goals may conflict with the players' desires. **Flaw/Secret**: It is bound by its original programming, which may be outdated or dangerous in the current world.

### Key Locations

- **The Grand Atrium**: The massive entrance chamber, filled with dormant machinery and the echoes of a forgotten past.
- **The Bio-Lumin Gardens**: A section of the Engine where artificial light sources create a unique, glowing ecosystem.
- **The Zero-G Spire**: A vertical shaft where gravity is absent, requiring specialized movement and combat tactics.
- **The Nexus Chamber**: The heart of the World-Engine, a place of immense power and technological wonder.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to understand and control a colossal, ancient machine that is a world unto itself. It's a quest for knowledge, power, and the secrets of a forgotten civilization, with the fate of the World-Engine (and perhaps the world outside) hanging in the balance.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Technological Scavenging & Malfunctions**: Players can scavenge "Tech Scraps" from defeated constructs or environmental hazards. These scraps can be used to repair their gear, craft temporary technological devices (e.g., a temporary force field, a grappling hook, a short-range energy weapon), or even attempt to interface with the Engine's systems. However, these devices are prone to "Technological Malfunctions." Critical failures on checks involving scavenged tech can cause it to explode, short-circuit, or produce unpredictable effects. This encourages players to experiment with the Engine's technology but also introduces an element of risk and resource management.
