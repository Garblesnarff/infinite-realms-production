# The Sunken Kingdom of Zancig

## Real-World Basis: The Zancigs
In the early 20th century, Julius and Agnes Zancig were a world-famous stage act who performed what appeared to be genuine telepathy. Julius would walk through the audience, picking up objects from people, and Agnes, blindfolded on stage, would describe them in perfect detail. Despite huge rewards offered, no one ever conclusively proved their act was based on a code.

## The RPG Twist
It wasn't a code. The Zancigs had discovered a "mental frequency" that allowed them to access a psychic space—a shared mind-scape or "Noosphere." They weren't just reading each other's minds; they were seeing through each other's eyes via this other dimension. This dimension, however, is not empty. It is a "sunken kingdom" of pure thought, inhabited by forgotten ideas, archetypes, and parasitic concepts that hunger for the attention of living minds.

## Campaign Premise (Psychological Thriller/Urban Fantasy)
The players are individuals who, through trauma, meditation, or sheer accident, have tuned into the "Zancig Frequency." They can perceive the mind-scape and, with practice, perform feats of telepathy and clairvoyance. This makes them targets for the parasitic "Ideas" that want to use them as anchors to manifest in the real world. The campaign would see the players trying to master their new abilities while defending their sanity and their reality from concepts-made-real—an "Anxiety" that stalks them as a physical monster, a "Forgotten Song" that tries to overwrite their memories, or a "Conspiracy Theory" that actively alters physical evidence to support its narrative.

## Key Elements
*   **The Noosphere:** The "Sunken Kingdom." This is a dimension made of pure thought. It can be navigated, but its landscape is fluid and shaped by the beliefs and emotions of humanity. It's a library of every thought ever had, a graveyard of forgotten gods, and a jungle of predatory memes.
*   **Ideomorphs:** The creatures that inhabit the Noosphere. They are personified concepts. Some are benign, like "Curiosity" or "Nostalgia." Others are dangerous parasites, like "Paranoia," "Doubt," or "Hate." The most powerful are the "Archetypes"—the Jungian figures that have immense power in the mind-scape.
*   **Mental Combat:** Conflicts are not always physical. A player might have to "fight" a manifestation of their own self-doubt, or engage in a battle of wits with a living riddle. Damage can be mental, temporarily removing skills or memories.
*   **Anchors:** To affect the real world, an Ideomorph needs an "Anchor"—a person, object, or even a place that gives it purchase. A key part of the game is identifying and "cleansing" these Anchors to banish the hostile entity.

## Tone
*Inception* meets *A Scanner Darkly*, a reality-bending mystery about the power of thought. It's a game of investigation and psychological survival, where the most dangerous weapon is an idea.
