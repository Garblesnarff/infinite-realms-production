# Creative Brief: Chronos Investigations, Inc.

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Sci-Fi Noir

Inspired by the moody, atmospheric, and stylish worlds of *Blade Runner*, *Deus Ex*, and classic film noir. This style blends the gritty realism of a detective story with the sleek, high-concept visuals of science fiction. The aesthetic should be cinematic, intriguing, and consistently cool, regardless of the era depicted.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Light and Shadow are Characters:** The interplay of light and shadow is the most important element. Describe the light source and the quality of the shadows it casts.
*   **Juxtaposition is Key:** The core of the style is the mix of the historical and the futuristic. Always try to include an element of both in a scene (e.g., a neon sign reflected in a medieval puddle).
*   **Think Like a Cinematographer:** Use terms related to camera shots, lighting, and mood to guide the composition.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Cinematic, moody, atmospheric, intriguing, high-contrast, noir, mysterious, sleek.
*   **Feeling:** The world is a place of secrets and high stakes, hidden just beneath the surface of history. There should be a sense of loneliness and contemplation, even in a crowd. Every shadow could hide a clue or a threat.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and detailed. The focus is on believable forms, textures, and lighting. This is not a stylized or cartoonish world. Photorealism is the goal.
*   **Textures:** Emphasize realistic textures: the grit of a brick wall, the dampness of a trench coat, the cold gleam of metal, the soft glow of a holographic interface.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic cinematic still. The focus is on the realistic texture of wet asphalt and the sharp reflections in the chrome...

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Generally dark and desaturated, but punctuated by vibrant, often neon, light sources. The core palette consists of deep blues, blacks, and grays.
*   **Accent Colors:** Accent colors come from light sources: the electric blue, magenta, or orange of neon signs, holographic displays, or temporal energy.
*   **Historical Eras:** In past settings, replace neon with the warm, sharp glow of torchlight, candlelight, or gas lamps, while still maintaining the deep shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark, desaturated color palette of deep blues and blacks, dramatically lit by the vibrant magenta glow of a holographic advertisement."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Realistic human proportions and features. Characters should look like they belong in a detective film.
*   **Clothing:** Era-appropriate clothing is essential, but often with a timeless or anachronistic flair. Think trench coats, sharp suits, and practical gear that looks subtly out of place.
*   **Expression:** Expressions are often subtle, guarded, or contemplative. This is a world of spies and detectives, not superheroes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A world-weary detective in a classic trench coat stands in an ancient Roman forum. His face is partially obscured by shadow, lit from below by the blue light of a handheld temporal scanner."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Grounded in historical reality but always with a sci-fi twist. The architecture is authentic to the period, but the lighting and technology are not.
*   **Atmosphere:** Use atmospheric effects heavily. Rain, fog, mist, and smoke help to diffuse light and create a sense of mystery and depth.
*   **Anachronisms:** The key is the subtle (or overt) placement of futuristic technology within a historical setting. A data-port on a stone wall, a floating drone in a Victorian alley, a temporal rift shimmering over a battlefield.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The scene is a rain-slicked medieval alleyway at night. The gothic architecture is authentic, but the scene is lit by the flickering neon sign of a noodle bar, casting long, deep shadows."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Hard, dramatic, high-contrast lighting is the defining feature. This is classic noir "low-key" lighting.
*   **Light Sources:** Light sources should be clearly defined and often come from the side, below, or behind the subject to create silhouettes and rim lighting.
*   **Shadows:** Shadows are deep, dark, and sharp. They are as important as the lit areas for defining the scene and creating mood.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatic low-key lighting, with a single, sharp light source from the side creating deep shadows across the character's face and the environment."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Deliberate and cinematic. Use classic film noir compositional techniques.
*   **Techniques:** Employ leading lines, framing (e.g., shooting through a doorway or window), and strong diagonals. Characters are often positioned off-center to create a sense of unease or mystery.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A cinematic, off-center composition, looking down a long, shadowy corridor. The character is a small silhouette in the distance, framed by a massive doorway."

## Voice

A smooth, world-weary male voice, like a worn-out tape recording from a forgotten case file. His standard American accent is tinged with the cynical wisdom of a thousand late nights, with a measured and contemplative pacing that allows the shadows to deepen. The emotion is a pervasive mystery, a cool detachment that hints at secrets too dark to speak aloud. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, almost imperceptible, echo that suggests vast, empty cityscapes and the quiet hum of temporal anomalies. Role: The hardboiled detective narrating his own descent into the labyrinth of time.
