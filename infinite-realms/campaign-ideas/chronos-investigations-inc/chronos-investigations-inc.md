- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Time Travel / Detective / Sci-Fi Fantasy

### Core Premise
The players are agents of Chronos Investigations, Inc., a highly secretive organization tasked with preserving the integrity of the timeline. When temporal anomalies, paradoxes, or outright historical sabotage occur, Chronos Inc. sends its best (or at least available) agents to investigate. Armed with limited time-travel technology and a deep understanding of historical causality, the players must jump through different eras, solve temporal mysteries, and prevent catastrophic changes to the past, all while trying not to create new paradoxes themselves.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Ripple Effects (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players are introduced to Chronos Inc. and sent on their first few cases: a historical figure mysteriously vanishing, an anachronistic artifact appearing in the wrong era, or a minor historical event playing out differently. They learn the rules of time travel and the dangers of paradoxes.

**Act 2: The Chronal Conspirators (Sessions 4-8)**
- The anomalies become more frequent and coordinated, pointing to a deliberate effort to alter history. The players uncover a shadowy organization, the "Achronists," who believe the timeline is flawed and seek to reshape it to their own design. The players must track the Achronists across different eras, engaging in temporal cat-and-mouse games.

**Act 3: The Grand Paradox (Sessions 9-12)**
- The Achronists launch their ultimate plan: a major historical alteration that threatens to unravel the entire timeline. The players must confront the Achronists at a critical historical juncture, preventing the grand paradox and restoring the timeline, even if it means making difficult choices about what history *should* be.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Orientation & First Jump**: The players are recruited into Chronos Inc. and given their first mission: a famous historical inventor's groundbreaking discovery has been replaced by a crude, anachronistic device. They jump to the past to investigate.
- **Session 2: The Missing Monarch**: A beloved monarch from a pivotal era has vanished, threatening a major war. The players must find them, discovering they were kidnapped by a temporal bounty hunter.
- **Session 3: The Anomaly in the Arena**: An ancient gladiatorial arena is suddenly filled with modern technology. The players must discreetly remove the tech and find out who planted it, avoiding detection by both ancient Romans and other temporal agents.
- **Session 4-5: Tracing the Achronists**: The anomalies become more complex, revealing a pattern. The players find a calling card of the Achronists, leading them on a chase through a medieval castle and a futuristic metropolis.
- **Session 6-7: The Temporal Heist**: The Achronists attempt to steal a crucial artifact from a heavily guarded historical event. The players must intervene, perhaps by posing as historical figures or using temporal trickery.
- **Session 8: The Echoes of a Future Past**: The players accidentally create a minor paradox, causing ripples that affect their own present. They must fix it before it becomes a major problem, learning the hard way about causality.
- **Session 9-10: The Point of Divergence**: The Achronists' grand plan is revealed: they intend to alter a pivotal moment in history. The players must travel to this moment, which could be anything from the invention of the printing press to the signing of a peace treaty.
- **Session 11-12: Restoring the Stream**: A multi-stage confrontation with the Achronists. The players must not only defeat them but also ensure the historical event plays out as it should, potentially making sacrifices or difficult moral choices. The campaign ends with the timeline restored, but the players forever changed by their experiences.

### Major NPCs

- **Director Paradox**: The enigmatic head of Chronos Investigations, Inc. **Role**: Quest Giver / Authority Figure. **Personality**: Calm, utterly focused on the timeline, speaks in precise, often cryptic terms. **Flaw/Secret**: He is a temporal anomaly himself, a being from a future that no longer exists, and his own existence is a constant paradox.
- **Agent "Tick-Tock" Thorne**: A veteran Chronos agent, cynical and world-weary. **Role**: Mentor / Rival. **Personality**: Gruff, sarcastic, and constantly warning the players about the dangers of time travel. **Flaw/Secret**: He once lost a partner to a paradox and is terrified of forming close bonds with new agents.
- **The Chronal Architect (Achronist Leader)**: The brilliant, charismatic leader of the Achronists. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Utterly convinced of their moral superiority, believes they are saving humanity by correcting history's mistakes. **Flaw/Secret**: They are from a timeline that was erased, and their entire existence is a desperate attempt to bring it back.

### Key Locations

- **The Chronos Inc. Headquarters**: A hidden facility that exists outside of normal time, filled with temporal monitors, historical archives, and time-travel devices.
- **The Temporal Nexus**: A fluctuating point in the timeline where multiple eras converge, making it a dangerous but useful hub for temporal travel.
- **The Echoing Battlefield**: A historical battlefield where a crucial event is about to unfold, but temporal echoes from other eras bleed through, creating a chaotic environment.
- **The Library of Lost Futures**: A theoretical location within the Achronists' base, containing records of timelines that never came to be.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to preserve a fragile timeline against those who seek to reshape it. It's a battle of wits, historical knowledge, and moral dilemmas across the vast expanse of time.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Paradox Points**: Players accumulate "Paradox Points" whenever they take actions that significantly risk altering the timeline (e.g., directly interacting with a past self, revealing future knowledge, preventing a historical death). Accumulating too many Paradox Points can lead to minor temporal glitches (e.g., objects disappearing/reappearing, temporary memory loss, encountering alternate versions of themselves) or, in severe cases, a "Temporal Backlash" where reality itself tries to correct the anomaly, often with dangerous consequences. This encourages careful planning and strategic use of their time-travel abilities, making every decision carry weight.
