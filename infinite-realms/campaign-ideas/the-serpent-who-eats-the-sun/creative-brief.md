# Creative Brief: The Serpent Who Eats the Sun

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Folk Horror / Unsettling Pastoral

Inspired by the bright, yet deeply disturbing aesthetics of films like *Midsommar* and classic folk horror. This style aims to capture the idyllic beauty of the island of Solmora, only to subtly (and then overtly) subvert it with creeping dread, ritualistic horror, and the vast, unknowable terror of a cosmic entity. The horror is often in plain sight, under a bright sun.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Juxtaposition:** Emphasize the contrast between beauty and horror, the natural and the unnatural, the idyllic and the grotesque.
*   **Subtle Disturbances:** Focus on small, unsettling details that hint at a deeper wrongness within an otherwise normal scene.
*   **Symbolism:** Integrate ancient, ritualistic, or natural symbols that foreshadow the cosmic horror.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Idyllic, unsettling, ritualistic, ancient, cosmic horror, tense, mysterious, pastoral, vibrant, dread-filled.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of false serenity that slowly unravels into profound terror. The world feels ancient and alive, but with a malevolent undercurrent. The beauty is a trap, and the familiar is subtly twisted.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and detailed, with a focus on natural forms and textures. Lines are often soft and organic for the natural environment, becoming sharper and more defined for ritualistic objects or moments of horror.
*   **Forms:** Characters and natural elements are rendered with a sense of grounded realism. The cosmic serpent, however, should be depicted with an otherworldly, ancient, and impossibly vast form.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting. The focus is on the intricate patterns of a woven tapestry, depicting an ancient, serpentine symbol, with a subtle, unsettling shimmer."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Predominantly vibrant, natural, and earthy tones for the island (lush greens, deep blues, warm yellows, sun-baked browns). These colors are often rich and saturated, creating a sense of life and beauty.
*   **Accent Colors:** When horror elements appear, colors can become more muted, or introduce unsettling hues like sickly greens, deep purples, or the fiery orange of the eclipse. The cosmic serpent might have an iridescent, ancient, or impossibly dark coloration.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Scenes are often bathed in bright, natural sunlight, making the horror more jarring. The eclipse moments will be dominated by dramatic, deep oranges, reds, and purples.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant, natural color palette of lush greens and sun-drenched yellows, with a single, unsettling accent of deep, ritualistic crimson on a ceremonial mask."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are realistically proportioned, often with a rustic or traditional appearance. Villagers appear cheerful and welcoming, but with subtle, unsettling uniformity or vacant expressions.
*   **Cultists:** When revealed, cultists wear traditional, often hand-crafted, robes or garments adorned with ancient symbols. Their masks are simple, often animalistic or abstract, and designed to be unnerving rather than elaborate.
*   **The Serpent:** The cosmic serpent should be ancient, colossal, and awe-inspiringly terrifying. Its design should evoke primordial power and an alien nature, perhaps with scales that resemble constellations or ancient runes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A group of cheerful villagers in traditional, hand-woven garments, their faces smiling but their eyes holding a disturbing, vacant quality. They are performing an ancient dance around a stone altar adorned with serpentine carvings."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The island is initially depicted as idyllic and beautiful: lush forests, pristine beaches, quaint fishing villages, and ancient ruins. This beauty is slowly corrupted or revealed to be a facade.
*   **Atmosphere:** Bright, clear skies initially, giving way to the dramatic, darkening skies of the eclipse. The air is often still and heavy, creating a sense of anticipation.
*   **Details:** Ancient stone circles, overgrown ruins, traditional wooden buildings, fishing boats, and the vast, open sea. The Sunken Temple should be ancient, waterlogged, and filled with primordial, unsettling architecture.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of an idyllic, sun-drenched island village nestled by a pristine blue sea. In the distance, a colossal, ancient stone monolith, covered in serpentine carvings, stands ominously on a cliff edge."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Predominantly bright, naturalistic lighting for most of the day, creating a sense of openness and vulnerability. Shadows are often long and sharp under the harsh sun.
*   **Eclipse Lighting:** During the eclipse, lighting becomes dramatic and otherworldly, with deep, rich oranges, reds, and purples dominating the sky, casting long, distorted shadows.
*   **Purpose:** The bright lighting makes the horror more jarring and inescapable. The eclipse lighting emphasizes the cosmic scale of the event.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...bathed in the harsh, direct sunlight of midday, casting sharp, defined shadows. The scene is vibrant and clear, making the subtle, unsettling details even more apparent."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, expansive shots to emphasize the beauty and scale of the island, and the smallness of the characters against the impending cosmic event. Can also use tighter shots to focus on unsettling details or character expressions.
*   **Techniques:** Employ leading lines (e.g., paths, shorelines) to draw the eye. Frame characters within natural elements or ritualistic structures. Use high angles to emphasize vulnerability or low angles to make the serpent appear colossal.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a group of characters standing on a beach, looking out at the vast ocean. In the distance, a colossal, ancient serpent, its scales shimmering with cosmic light, begins to rise from the depths, dwarfing the island."

## Voice

A deep, resonant, and subtly sibilant gender-neutral voice, like a whisper carried on a hot, dry wind across ancient, sun-baked stones. The pacing is slow and deliberate, each word drawn out with unnerving pauses, as if the words themselves are ancient and heavy with cosmic significance. The emotion is a blend of primordial power, cold amusement, and a profound, cosmic indifference to human suffering. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a pervasive, low-frequency hum and the faint, ambient sound of distant, ritualistic chanting, emphasizing the vast, unknowable terror of the entity. Role: The voice of the cosmic serpent itself, or an ancient, corrupted oracle whispering prophecies of the end of days.
