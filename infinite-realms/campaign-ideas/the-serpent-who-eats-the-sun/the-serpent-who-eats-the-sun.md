**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time-Loop Mystery / Cosmic Horror / Investigation
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **6** → Finish **11–12**

**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players are visiting the remote island of Solmora to witness the "Sun-Swallowing Festival," a rare total eclipse. As darkness falls, a terrifying ritual is completed, a cosmic serpent rises from the sea, and the world ends. The players then awaken in their beds at the start of the festival day, the only ones who remember the apocalypse. They are trapped in a time loop and must use their repeating knowledge to uncover the island's dark conspiracy and stop the doomsday cult before the loop—and the world—ends for good.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A race against a repeating clock to prevent the end of the world.

*   **Act I — The First Dawn (Sessions 1–2):** The party experiences the festival day for the first time, meeting the locals and enjoying the festivities, which culminates in the shocking, world-ending apocalypse. They awaken, confused, and must spend the next loop confirming they are trapped in time and are the only ones aware of it.
*   **Act II — The Unraveling (Sessions 3–6):** The campaign becomes a non-linear investigation. The players use their foreknowledge to be in the right place at the right time, gathering clues, identifying the cultists hidden among the cheerful villagers, and discovering the mechanics of the ritual.
*   **Act III — Breaking the Cycle (Sessions 7–10):** Armed with a complete understanding of the day's events, the party must execute a perfect, multi-stage plan to disrupt the ritual. This involves a series of coordinated strikes throughout the day, culminating in a final battle against the cult's leadership and the nascent form of the serpent god as the eclipse begins.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Festival and the Feast”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / The Twist
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives on the idyllic island of Solmora and enjoys the festival: they can participate in games, talk to friendly locals, and learn about the island's strange traditions.
    *   As the eclipse reaches totality, the island's leaders reveal themselves as cultists and complete their ritual.
    *   The party watches, helpless, as a colossal serpent devours the sun, before they awaken with a gasp in their beds at the inn.
**Escalation:** The first loop ends. The players are the only ones who remember.

### Sessions 2-4 — “A Stitch in Time”
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Information Gathering
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players use their knowledge to start investigating. They know who the cult leaders are, but not where or how the ritual is performed.
    *   They can now be in the right place to overhear a secret conversation, follow a suspicious villager, or steal a key they saw on a previous loop.
    *   They begin to piece together the day's hidden schedule of events.
**Escalation:** The cult has magical wards that can detect hostile intent. If the players act too aggressively or obviously, the cultists become suspicious and change their plans for that loop, forcing the players to adapt.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Sunken Temple”
*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Puzzle
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party discovers the ritual takes place in a hidden, sunken temple that is only accessible at low tide, which occurs just before the eclipse.
    *   They must use a loop to explore the temple, solving its puzzles and defeating its guardians.
    *   They learn what is required for the ritual: three ancient relics hidden across the island.
**Escalation:** The temple is protected by a guardian who remembers them from previous loops. It has been adapting its defenses each time they have entered, making each run progressively harder.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Elder Maeve** — *The Kindly Leader / The High Priestess*
    *   **Role:** The seemingly warm and welcoming matriarch of the island.
    *   **Personality:** On the surface, she is a sweet, grandmotherly figure. In reality, she is the cold, fanatical leader of the doomsday cult.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She truly believes the serpent is a benevolent god, "The Great Purifier," and that ending the world is an act of mercy. She cannot be reasoned with, only stopped.

2.  **Kael, the Lighthouse Keeper** — *The Paranoid Ally*
    *   **Role:** A brooding, antisocial outsider who maintains the island's lighthouse. He is the only other person who suspects something is wrong on the island.
    *   **Personality:** Gruff, paranoid, and distrustful. He has been tracking the villagers' strange behavior for years.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is a former member of an order dedicated to stopping cosmic threats. He came to the island to investigate the cult but failed, and is now consumed by guilt and fear. He is also not in the loop, so the party must convince him of the truth each day.

3.  **The Laughing Child** — *The Avatar*
    *   **Role:** A strange, silent child who is always seen at the edges of every festival event, smiling.
    *   **Personality:** Silent, observant, and unnerving. It never speaks, but seems to know exactly who the players are and what they are trying to do.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The child is a nascent avatar of the serpent god, a psychic anchor for its arrival. The child is the true target of the ritual's final stage, and harming it has dire, unforeseen consequences on the loop.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Village of Ouroboros:** A cheerful, idyllic fishing village with a dark secret.
2.  **The Lighthouse:** A tall, lonely spire on the cliffs, offering the best vantage point of the island.
3.  **The Tidal Caves:** A network of caves on the coast that flood with the tide, where the cult hides its ritual components.
4.  **The Sunken Temple of the Serpent:** An ancient, underwater temple that is only accessible for a few hours each day, where the final ritual takes place.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a puzzle box, where the solution requires perfect knowledge and execution. The central conflict is a battle against a conspiracy armed with the ultimate weapon: time. The players have infinite chances to succeed, but they must also endure the psychological toll of watching the world end, again and again, until they get it right.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Time Loop**
*   The core of the campaign. At the end of the day (or if all players die), the day resets. The players retain their memories, XP, levels, and any knowledge they have gained. All other characters, items, and the state of the world reset completely.
*   This allows for consequence-free experimentation. Players can try a risky plan, and if it fails, they can try something different on the next loop, armed with new knowledge.
*   The DM should track key information the players have learned on a shared document, creating a sense of progress despite the repetition.

### 2. **The Schedule of Events**
*   The DM has a master timeline for the festival day, detailing what every key NPC is doing and where they are at every hour (e.g., "9 AM: The baker delivers bread to Elder Maeve." "2 PM: Kael leaves the lighthouse to go to the tavern.").
*   The players do not know this schedule initially. The core of the investigation is for them to learn this schedule through observation, interrogation, and trial-and-error across multiple loops.
*   Once they know the schedule, they can plan their day perfectly, intercepting people and items at the precise moment needed to disrupt the cult's plan.
