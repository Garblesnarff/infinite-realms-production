### Core Premise
The players live in the city of Aegis, a sprawling metropolis built upon the back of a colossal, ancient beast known as the "World-Walker." For centuries, Aegis has roamed the vast, uncharted lands, its inhabitants adapting to life on a living, moving landscape. However, the World-Walker is growing old, its movements becoming erratic, and its health failing. Strange parasites infest its hide, and its internal systems (volcanoes, rivers, forests) are becoming unstable. The players, as citizens of Aegis, must venture into the beast's uncharted territories, both external and internal, to understand its ailments, protect their city, and perhaps even guide the Colossus to a final, safe resting place.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Life on the Back (Sessions 1-3)**
- The campaign begins with the players experiencing the unique challenges of life on the World-Walker: sudden shifts in terrain, encounters with creatures native to its hide, and the constant need for maintenance of the city's infrastructure. They notice the Colossus's health deteriorating, leading to increased instability and danger.

**Act 2: The Beast's Ailments (Sessions 4-8)**
- As the World-Walker's condition worsens, the players must venture into its more dangerous, unexplored regions – its vast, internal organs (e.g., the Lung-Forests, the Circulatory Rivers) or its external, parasite-infested hide. They discover that the Colossus is not merely old, but is suffering from a specific ailment, perhaps a colossal parasite, a magical curse, or a technological malfunction from a forgotten era.

**Act 3: The Final Journey (Sessions 9-12)**
- The players locate the source of the World-Walker's suffering. They must confront this threat, either by purging it, healing it, or making a difficult choice about the Colossus's final fate. The campaign culminates in a desperate attempt to save the World-Walker, guide it to a safe haven, or prepare Aegis for a life without its colossal protector.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Great Shift**: The World-Walker makes a sudden, violent movement, causing chaos in Aegis. The players must help stabilize the city, rescue citizens, and deal with creatures dislodged from the beast's hide. They notice the Colossus's health is failing.
- **Session 2: The Hide-Hunters**: The players are tasked with hunting a new, aggressive species of parasite that has infested the World-Walker's hide, threatening the city's foundations. Introduction to the "Mobile Environment" mechanic.
- **Session 3: The Internal Tremors**: The World-Walker experiences internal spasms, causing localized earthquakes and volcanic eruptions within Aegis. The players must venture into the beast's internal caverns to investigate the cause.
- **Session 4-5: The Lung-Forests**: They explore the vast, oxygen-rich Lung-Forests within the World-Walker, encountering unique flora and fauna, and finding ancient ruins or a data-log hinting at the Colossus's origin.
- **Session 6-7: The Circulatory Rivers**: The players must navigate the World-Walker's massive internal river systems, which act as its blood vessels. They discover signs of a foreign contaminant or a blockage.
- **Session 8: The City's Heart**: They delve into the World-Walker's central nervous system, a network of glowing crystals or pulsating organs. Here, they might experience psychic echoes of the Colossus's thoughts and memories, revealing its history or a potential cure.
- **Session 9-10: The Great Parasite**: The players locate the source of the World-Walker's ailment – a colossal, alien parasite, a magically engineered disease, or a malfunctioning ancient device embedded within its body.
- **Session 11-12: The Colossus's Choice**: A climactic confrontation with the threat. The players must either purge the parasite, repair the damage, or make a difficult choice about the World-Walker's final journey. The campaign ends with Aegis finding a new home, or the players becoming the new guardians of the Colossus.

### Major NPCs

- **Elder Kaelen, the Scale-Speaker**: The ancient, wise leader of Aegis, who can communicate with the World-Walker. **Role**: Guide / Oracle. **Personality**: Calm, patient, but deeply burdened by the Colossus's suffering. **Flaw/Secret**: Her connection to the World-Walker is fading, and she fears she is losing her mind as the beast declines.
- **Captain Valerius, the Sky-Harpooner**: A gruff, pragmatic leader of the city's external defense force. **Role**: Ally / Obstacle. **Personality**: Brave, resourceful, but distrustful of anything that isn't tangible. **Flaw/Secret**: He believes the World-Walker is merely a beast and should be abandoned if it becomes too dangerous, putting him at odds with the Scale-Speaker.
- **The Hive Mind (Antagonist)**: The collective consciousness of the colossal parasites infesting the World-Walker. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Instinctual, relentless, and views the Colossus as merely a food source. **Flaw/Secret**: It is vulnerable to specific frequencies or magical energies that disrupt its collective thought.

### Key Locations

- **The City of Aegis**: A sprawling, multi-tiered city built into the World-Walker's hide, with districts for different races and functions.
- **The Great Spine**: The colossal backbone of the World-Walker, a mountain range that runs through the center of Aegis.
- **The Lung-Forests**: Vast, internal caverns filled with unique, oxygen-producing flora, acting as the beast's respiratory system.
- **The Heart-Chamber**: A massive, pulsating chamber deep within the World-Walker, the source of its life force.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to save their mobile home and its colossal protector from internal and external threats, while navigating the unique challenges of life on a living world. It's a quest for survival, understanding, and the delicate balance between civilization and nature.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Mobile Environment & World-Walker's Health**: The environment is constantly changing due to the World-Walker's movements and health. Each session, a "Colossus Event" occurs (e.g., a sudden tilt, a localized tremor, a change in internal temperature, a new parasite outbreak). Players must adapt to these changes, making skill checks to avoid falling, navigate shifting terrain, or repair damaged infrastructure. Additionally, the World-Walker has a visible "Health Bar." As its health declines, Colossus Events become more frequent and severe, and new environmental hazards appear. This mechanic makes the entire world a dynamic, living entity that players must constantly monitor and react to, emphasizing the precariousness of their existence.
