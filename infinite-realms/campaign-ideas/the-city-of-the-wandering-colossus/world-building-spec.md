### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The City of the Wandering Colossus**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The players are citizens of Aegis, a city built on the back of a colossal, ancient, living beast known as the "World-Walker." When the creature's health begins to fail, its movements becoming erratic and its internal ecosystems unstable, the players must venture into its uncharted territories—both external and internal—to diagnose its ailments, protect their city, and guide the colossus to a safe resting place.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of the city of Aegis. How and why was it built on the World-Walker?
    *   Write the legend of the World-Walker's origin. Is it a god, a primordial, or a biological anomaly?
    *   Describe the unique symbiotic relationship between the city and the colossus.
    *   Explain the culture of the Scale-Speakers and how they communicate with the World-Walker.
    *   Detail the story of a past "Great Shift" where the colossus's violent movement nearly destroyed the city.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Scale-Speakers** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To preserve the life and health of the World-Walker at all costs.
        *   **Hierarchy:** An ancient order of mystics and shamans, led by Elder Kaelen.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To act as the spiritual guides of Aegis and interpret the will of the World-Walker.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They know the World-Walker is dying and are hiding this truth from the populace to prevent a panic.
        *   **Assets:** The ability to communicate with the colossus, ancient knowledge of its biology, the loyalty of the city's faithful.
        *   **Relationships:** In political conflict with the Sky-Harpooners, whom they see as disrespectful and short-sighted.
    *   **The Sky-Harpooners** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To protect the city of Aegis from external threats and internal parasites.
        *   **Hierarchy:** The city's official defense force, led by the pragmatic Captain Valerius.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To be the shield of Aegis.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They are secretly developing a plan to abandon the World-Walker and build a new, static city if the colossus becomes too great a threat.
        *   **Assets:** A small fleet of airships, skilled warriors, control of the city's external defenses.
        *   **Relationships:** View the Scale-Speakers as mystics who would sacrifice the city for the beast.
    *   **The Hive Mind** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To consume the World-Walker from the inside out.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A collective consciousness controlling a swarm of colossal parasites.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They are an instinctual, predatory force.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To reach the World-Walker's heart and transform the entire colossus into a new hive.
        *   **Assets:** A vast swarm of parasitic creatures, the ability to corrupt the colossus's internal ecosystems.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonists, a direct threat to both the city and the colossus.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Elder Kaelen, the Scale-Speaker:** The ancient, wise, and burdened leader of Aegis, whose connection to the World-Walker is fading.
    *   **Captain Valerius, the Sky-Harpooner:** The gruff, pragmatic, and brave leader of the city's defense force.
    *   **The Hive Mind:** The alien, instinctual, and relentless collective consciousness of the parasites.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Young, Hopeful Scale-Speaker Acolyte"

    *   **The Great Spine:** The colossal backbone of the World-Walker, a mountain range that runs through the center of Aegis.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The city of Aegis itself, the highest peak (The Crown), a series of deep, ancient scars, the nests of giant avians.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The citizens of Aegis, giant eagles, hide-parasites.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** All the services of a major city, but with the constant risk of a shift.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A sudden tremor as the colossus shifts its weight, a flock of giant birds attacks a merchant caravan, a valuable mineral deposit is exposed after a rockslide, a citizen is about to fall from a ledge, a parasite swarm attacks the city's foundations.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The oldest part of the city is near the Crown, where the Scale-Speakers first made contact." "The Sky-Harpooners are building a secret outpost on the far side of the Spine." "The scars on the beast's back are from a battle with another colossus, long ago."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (A sprawling city on a living mountain, distant clouds below, the curve of the colossus's back), Sound (The wind, the distant hum of the city, the groan of the beast), Smell (City smells, clean mountain air).
    *   **The Lung-Forests:** Vast, internal caverns filled with unique, oxygen-producing flora, acting as the beast's respiratory system.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Great Bronchial Trees, a river of mucus, a field of glowing, spore-releasing fungi, the ruins of an ancient, swallowed civilization.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Unique insects and amphibians, symbiotic organisms, the Hive Mind's parasites.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Rare alchemical ingredients, breathable air.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A sudden, hurricane-force inhale/exhale, a patch of hallucinogenic fungi, a swarm of parasitic insects, the party discovers a creature that helps regulate the beast's breathing, the walls of the cavern begin to secrete a digestive fluid.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Hive Mind is building its primary nest in the left lung." "The ruins in the forest belong to a people who tried to control the World-Walker from the inside." "The Scale-Speakers have a hidden sanctuary deep within the forests."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Bioluminescent flora, thick fog, spongy, pulsating walls), Sound (A constant, wet wind; the chittering of strange insects; a deep, rhythmic breathing), Smell (Damp earth, pollen, a strange, clean scent of oxygen).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A "Colossus Event" occurs at the start of a session.
    *   **THEN:** The World-Walker's Health tracker worsens. Generate a new environmental challenge for the players (e.g., a tremor causes a building in Aegis to become unstable, a new type of parasite appears on the hide).
    *   **IF:** The players successfully clear a major parasite infestation from the colossus's hide.
    *   **THEN:** The World-Walker's Health temporarily improves. Elder Kaelen grants the party a boon, and their reputation in Aegis increases.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the Sky-Harpooners' secret plan to abandon the colossus.
    *   **THEN:** They can choose to expose the plan, causing a civil war within Aegis, or use the information to blackmail Captain Valerius into helping them.
    *   **IF:** The players manage to establish a psychic link with the World-Walker in the Heart-Chamber.
    *   **THEN:** The colossus shows them a vision of its destination: a mythical place known as the "Giant's Graveyard," its final resting place. The campaign's objective shifts to guiding the beast on this final journey.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players successfully purge the Hive Mind's queen from the World-Walker's heart.
    *   **THEN:** The colossus is saved, but the psychic shock of the event erases its sense of direction. Generate an epilogue where the city of Aegis is now adrift on a healthy but aimless giant, becoming true wanderers for the first time.
