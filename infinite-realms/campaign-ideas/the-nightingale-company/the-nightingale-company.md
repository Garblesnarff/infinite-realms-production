# The Nightingale Company

## Real-World Basis: The Ghost Army
During World War II, the U.S. Army's 23rd Headquarters Special Troops was a tactical deception unit. This "Ghost Army" used inflatable tanks, sound trucks broadcasting the noise of troop movements, and fake radio transmissions to mislead Axis forces, often making the enemy believe entire divisions were present when, in fact, there were only a few hundred men. Their operations are credited with saving thousands of lives.

## D&D Twist
In a great war against a tyrannical hobgoblin empire, a kingdom forms a special operations company composed entirely of its best illusionists, bards, and trickery clerics. Known as "The Nightingale Company," their purpose is to deceive and demoralize the enemy. Their greatest deception is a powerful, complex illusion of a colossal, ancient dragon, used to scatter hobgoblin legions in terror. During a desperate, last-stand battle, the collective psychic energy of the company, amplified by the desperate belief of the soldiers they were protecting, caused the illusion to gain a semblance of reality. It became a "Thought-Form"—a creature of pure belief and arcane energy. Now, this phantom dragon, unstable and untethered from its creators, has gone rogue.

## Campaign Premise (Military Fantasy/Espionage)
The players are the core members of the Nightingale Company. The war is over, but their creation is now a terrifying ghost story, a mysterious force that obliterates military patrols and merchant caravans on all sides. Blamed for this new threat and fearing the power they wield, the kingdom has disavowed them. The players must operate from the shadows, hunted by their former allies and the hobgoblin remnants. They must track their phantom dragon across the war-scarred landscape, trying to either unravel the powerful magic that gave it life or bring the unstable Thought-Form under their control before it triggers a new, even deadlier war.

## Key Elements
*   **A Unique Quarry:** The players are not hunting a normal monster. The phantom dragon is a creature of illusion and belief. It is intelligent but thinks in alien ways. It might be defeated not by swords, but by convincing people it doesn't exist, or by creating an even more powerful, opposing belief.
*   **Masters of Deception:** The players' core skills are illusion, persuasion, and stealth. Challenges should be geared towards creative problem-solving rather than direct combat. How do you sneak past a patrol? By creating an illusory checkpoint. How do you defeat a heavily armed bounty hunter? By convincing him you're his long-lost brother.
*   **A World Recovering from War:** The setting is a landscape of fragile truces and simmering resentment. The players must navigate the complex politics of a post-war world, where their very existence is a threat to the peace.
*   **The Power of Belief:** The central theme. The campaign can explore how belief shapes reality. The players might discover that other, older Thought-Forms exist, born from the world's myths and legends.

## Tone
*A-Team* meets *The Prestige* in a fantasy military setting. A story of redemption, responsibility, and creative problem-solving, where the players are spies and artists, and their greatest creation has become their most dangerous enemy.
