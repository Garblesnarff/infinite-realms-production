# The Last Bastion

*A Kaiju / Survival Horror campaign — Short Campaign (6–8 sessions) — Hard difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Last Bastion
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Kaiju / Survival Horror
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **5–6**
**Tone (keywords):** terrifying, apocalyptic, desperate, small-scale, heroic
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
A colossal, city-destroying monster, the Tarrasque, has awakened from its slumber and is rampaging across the land. The party is not a group of epic heroes destined to slay the beast, but a handful of ordinary citizens—guards, artisans, and scholars—trapped in the city of Bastion, the last major settlement standing in the creature's path. They must survive the city's collapse, navigate the monster-made ruins, and escort a small group of fellow survivors to a rumored safe haven, all while being hunted by the Tarrasque and the smaller, parasitic creatures that feast in its wake.

## What “Hard” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The Tarrasque is an unstoppable force of nature, not a monster to be fought. Direct confrontation is suicide. The party will face challenges that require them to use their wits, their environment, and their courage to survive. Combat will be against smaller, parasitic creatures or desperate, panicked citizens.
*   **Survival:** The city is collapsing, and the party must constantly deal with environmental hazards, from falling buildings to gas leaks to floods. They must also scavenge for food, water, and medical supplies.
*   **Consequences:** Death is a constant threat. The party is fragile, and the world is a meat grinder. The goal is not to win, but to survive.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Tarrasque as an Environmental Hazard**

*   The Tarrasque is not a monster to be fought, but an environmental hazard to be avoided. The DM can use the Tarrasque to create a variety of challenges, from causing earthquakes to blocking the party's path to creating swarms of parasitic creatures.

### 2. **The Survivor Caravan**

*   The party is not just responsible for their own survival, but also for the survival of a small group of NPCs. The DM can create a simple system for tracking the health and morale of the survivors, which will be affected by the party's actions.

### 3. **Scavenging and Crafting**

*   The party will need to scavenge for supplies to survive. They can find food, water, weapons, and other useful items in the ruins of the city. They can also use the materials they find to craft and repair their own equipment.
