### Core Premise
Centuries ago, the gods vanished. Their divine power, once the bedrock of reality, is slowly fading, causing the very fabric of existence to unravel. Magic is becoming unpredictable, ancient prophecies are failing, and the world is slowly succumbing to a creeping entropy. The players are individuals touched by the last vestiges of divine power, tasked with investigating the gods' disappearance, seeking a way to restore their presence, or finding a new source of cosmic stability before reality collapses entirely. They must navigate a world where miracles are rare, and the echoes of dead gods whisper of forgotten truths and impending doom.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Fading Miracles (Sessions 1-4)**
- The campaign begins as the effects of the gods' absence become undeniable: a sacred river runs dry, a protective ward fails, or a divine prophecy goes awry. The players, perhaps blessed with a fragment of divine power, are drawn into the mystery. They encounter cults worshipping forgotten deities, desperate priests, and the first signs of reality's unraveling.

**Act 2: Echoes of Divinity (Sessions 5-10)**
- As they delve deeper, the players discover that the gods' disappearance was not a simple vanishing, but a catastrophic event, perhaps a divine war, a cosmic betrayal, or a self-sacrifice. They seek out ancient temples, forgotten holy sites, or the last remaining divine artifacts, each holding a fragment of the gods' power or a clue to their fate. They encounter entities that thrive in the absence of divine order, or those who seek to exploit the fading power.

**Act 3: The Cosmic Void (Sessions 11-15)**
- The players locate the true cause of the gods' absence or the source of the cosmic entropy. This could be a powerful entity that consumed the gods, a tear in the fabric of reality, or a forgotten ritual that needs to be completed. They must confront this threat, either by restoring the gods, finding a new source of divine power, or making a desperate sacrifice to prevent total annihilation. The campaign culminates in a climactic confrontation that will determine the fate of reality itself.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Broken Blessing**: A sacred site or a divine blessing that has protected a region for centuries suddenly fails, causing chaos. The players, perhaps touched by a fading divine spark, are drawn to investigate. Introduction to the "Divine Resonance" mechanic.
- **Session 2: The Desperate Priests**: They encounter a desperate religious order trying to maintain faith and order in the absence of their gods. The players might help them perform a ritual, only for it to fail or produce unpredictable results.
- **Session 3: The Unraveling Lands**: They venture into a region where reality itself is beginning to fray – gravity is inconsistent, colors are distorted, and creatures are mutating. They find a clue hinting at the gods' disappearance.
- **Session 4-5: The Whispering Temple**: The players discover an ancient, forgotten temple dedicated to a lost god. Inside, they find fragmented divine echoes or a powerful artifact that reveals a piece of the gods' fate.
- **Session 6-7: The Divine Scars**: They investigate a site of a massive, ancient magical catastrophe, perhaps a battlefield where the gods fought their last war. They encounter powerful, lingering magical anomalies and entities that feed on divine energy.
- **Session 8: The Last Oracle**: They seek out a reclusive, ancient oracle who was once a direct conduit to the gods. The oracle is now mad, speaking in riddles and fragmented visions, but holds a crucial piece of the puzzle.
- **Session 9-10: The Cosmic Tear**: The players locate a massive tear in the fabric of reality, a wound left by the gods' disappearance, through which strange, alien energies are bleeding into the world.
- **Session 11-12: The God-Eater (or The Void)**: The players locate the entity or phenomenon responsible for the gods' absence – perhaps a colossal cosmic horror, a powerful artifact that consumed divine energy, or a primordial void.
- **Session 13-15: The Grand Restoration**: A climactic confrontation with the threat. The players must either restore the gods, find a new source of divine power, or make a desperate sacrifice to prevent total annihilation. The campaign ends with the world saved, but forever changed, or its ultimate collapse.

### Major NPCs

- **The Last Prophet, Elias**: An ancient, blind prophet who still receives fragmented visions from the fading divine echoes. **Role**: Guide / Cryptic Informant. **Personality**: World-weary, melancholic, and speaks in metaphors. **Flaw/Secret**: He is slowly being consumed by the chaotic divine energy, and his prophecies are becoming increasingly unreliable.
- **The Void-Touched Cult**: A nihilistic cult that believes the gods' absence is a liberation and seeks to accelerate reality's collapse. **Role**: Antagonists. **Personality**: Fanatical, serene in their madness, and believe that true freedom lies in oblivion. **Flaw/Secret**: Their leader is a being from the void, subtly manipulating them to bring about the end of all things.
- **The Divine Remnant (e.g., a minor deity, a powerful angel)**: A powerful, but weakened, entity that is a last vestige of the gods' presence. **Role**: Ambiguous Ally / Obstacle. **Personality**: Desperate, powerful, but often erratic due to its fading power. **Flaw/Secret**: It is trying to restore its own power, even if it means sacrificing the players or other mortals.

### Key Locations

- **The Silent Temples**: Ancient, crumbling temples where the gods' presence once shone brightly, now eerily quiet and devoid of divine energy.
- **The Unraveling Lands**: Regions where reality itself is breaking down, creating surreal landscapes and dangerous anomalies.
- **The Cosmic Scar**: A massive wound in the sky or on the land, a physical manifestation of the gods' disappearance.
- **The Nexus of Echoes**: A legendary site where the last vestiges of divine power converge, a potential key to restoring the gods.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to prevent the collapse of reality in a world abandoned by its gods. It's a quest for cosmic truth, divine power, and the fight against entropy, with the very existence of the multiverse at stake.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Divine Resonance & Reality Strain**: Players have a "Divine Resonance" score, representing their connection to the fading divine power. This score increases by performing acts of faith, recovering divine artifacts, or completing ancient rituals. A higher Divine Resonance grants boons (e.g., temporary divine blessings, enhanced spellcasting, resistance to reality-bending effects). However, the world also has a "Reality Strain" tracker. As Reality Strain increases (due to plot events, powerful magic, or the players' actions), the world experiences more frequent and severe reality-bending effects (e.g., gravity fluctuations, spontaneous mutations, temporary loss of magic). Players can attempt to reduce Reality Strain through powerful rituals or by making significant sacrifices. This mechanic emphasizes the fragility of their world and the constant struggle against its unraveling.
