## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions)

A shadow war fought with secrets and daggers.

*   **Act I — The Defector (Sessions 1–3):** The party's first mission is to extract a high-ranking Technocracy scientist who holds the key to a new type of elemental weapon. They must arrange a clandestine meeting, navigate the city's checkpoints, and get the scientist to a safe house before the Technocracy's secret police can catch him.
*   **Act II — Ghost Protocol (Sessions 4–7):** A mission to sabotage an Aurelian listening post goes horribly wrong, and the party is disavowed by their own agency to maintain plausible deniability. Hunted by both sides, they must use their underworld contacts and tradecraft to survive and uncover who betrayed them, revealing a rogue third faction trying to incite open war.
*   **Act III — The Dead Drop (Sessions 8–12):** The party learns the rogue faction plans to detonate a magical "truth bomb" in the city center during a peace summit, a spell that would force every diplomat and spy to reveal their deepest secrets, guaranteeing war. They must race against time to find the location of the spell (the "dead drop") and neutralize the rogue agents before they can trigger a global catastrophe.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Man on the Bridge”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Stealth
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party receives their mission from their handler, "Control," via a coded message.
    *   They must make contact with the defector on the city's crowded Bridge of Whispers at a specific time.
    *   They must then escort him back to their safe house, using their skills to evade both Aurelian and Technocracy patrols who are monitoring the bridge.
**Escalation:** The defector has a magical tracker implanted in him. The party must find a way to remove it without killing him before elite Technocracy agents close in on their position.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Listening Post”
*   **Focus:** Infiltration / Sabotage
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Control tasks the party with infiltrating the Aurelian Embassy, a heavily guarded building, to plant a magical listening device.
    *   This requires careful planning: acquiring blueprints, creating fake identities, and bypassing magical and mundane security systems.
    *   The mission is a setup. As soon as they plant the device, an alarm sounds, and they are framed for an assassination attempt.
**Escalation:** Their handler, Control, sends them a final, one-word message: "BURNED." All their official support is cut off. They are on their own.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Night Clerk”
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   Now fugitives, the party must seek help from Kaisia's underworld.
    *   They are directed to "The Night Clerk," the proprietor of a seedy hotel that is secretly a neutral ground for spies.
    *   The Night Clerk, for a price, provides them with information about the rogue faction and helps them establish new cover identities.
**Escalation:** The party's primary antagonist, the head of the Aurelian secret police, raids the hotel, forcing the party to escape through a network of secret tunnels while protecting the Night Clerk.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Control** — *The Handler*
    *   **Role:** The party's enigmatic and unseen spymaster.
    *   **Personality:** Known to the party only as a voice in a *Sending Stone* or a string of text in a coded message. Control is professional, detached, and gives orders without explanation.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Control is not a single person, but a council of spymasters from neutral nations. This can lead to conflicting orders or a slow response time in a crisis, as the council must vote on a course of action.

2.  **The Night Clerk (Silas)** — *The Information Broker*
    *   **Role:** The proprietor of the "Faded Rose Hotel," a neutral safe house and information hub for the city's spies.
    *   **Personality:** World-weary, cynical, and impeccably neutral. He has seen it all and is loyal to nothing but the sanctity of his establishment and the flow of information. He helps everyone, for the right price.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He maintains his neutrality by trading information with all sides. Any secret the party tells him may eventually find its way to their enemies if the price is right.

3.  **Inquisitor Valeriana** — *The Antagonist*
    *   **Role:** The ruthless and brilliant head of the Aurelian Empire's secret police, the "Eyes of Truth."
    *   **Personality:** Pious, sharp, and sees the world in black and white. She believes the Technocracy is a corrupting influence and will use any means necessary to win the cold war for her empire. She is a formidable and intelligent adversary.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her faith borders on fanaticism. She is so convinced of her own righteousness that she is blind to the existence of the third, rogue faction, viewing all their actions as part of the Technocracy's master plan.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Veiled City of Kaisia:** A perpetually foggy, gothic metropolis, divided into Aurelian, Technocracy, and Neutral sectors.
2.  **Checkpoint Charlie-7:** The main checkpoint between the city's rival sectors, a place of high tension, forged papers, and desperate people.
3.  **Embassy Row:** A street of heavily fortified embassies, each a small island of sovereign, hostile territory.
4.  **The Dead Letter Office:** A dusty, forgotten post office used by spies from all factions as a neutral ground for dead drops and secret meetings.

## Central Conflict

This is a paranoid thriller where information is the deadliest weapon and trust is a fatal liability. The central conflict is the struggle to prevent a catastrophic war through subtlety and subterfuge, not open battle. The players must constantly question motives, watch their backs, and make difficult choices in a world of moral grey areas.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Cover & Heat System**
*   Each player has a **Cover Identity** (a fake name, profession, and papers). Actions that draw attention—using powerful magic, failing a stealth check, being seen in a restricted area—generate **Heat** points.
*   As Heat accumulates, the city's factions take notice. At 5 Heat, the party is being actively watched. At 10 Heat, their Cover is **Burned**, and they are hunted by enemy agents, forcing them to spend time and resources creating a new identity.
*   Players can reduce Heat by lying low, successfully using Disguise or Deception, or spending gold to have a forger create new, clean papers.

### 2. **Tradecraft & Gadgets**
*   The party has access to espionage-themed magical **Gadgets** instead of traditional magic items. These are often single-use or have limited charges, encouraging creative, tactical use.
*   *Examples: A **Scroll of Erased Footsteps** that makes the party untrackable for one hour. A **Sending Stone** that crumbles to dust after one use. A **Glove of Impeccable Forgery** that grants advantage on checks to fake handwriting. A **Coin of Distraction** that can be magically commanded to make a loud noise elsewhere.*
