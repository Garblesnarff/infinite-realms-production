**The Crimson Wilderness: Echoes of the Ancient Blight**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Deep in the heart of the Crimson Wilderness, an ancient corruption festers like a wound that refuses to heal. The players, sole survivors of a devastating expedition ambush, find themselves stranded in this unforgiving landscape where the very land itself seems to hunger for their lives. As they struggle to survive against twisted beasts, supernatural phenomena, and the creeping madness of isolation, they uncover clues pointing to an ancient evil that has slumbered beneath the crimson canopy for centuries. Their quest for survival becomes a desperate race to understand the source of the corruption before it consumes them and spreads to the civilized world beyond the wilderness.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the ancient civilization that originally inhabited the Crimson Wilderness and their eventual downfall through forbidden magical experimentation.
    *   Write the history of the "Crimson Blight" - the catastrophic magical event that corrupted the land and created the wilderness as it exists today.
    *   Describe the nature of the corruption itself - is it a conscious entity, a magical radiation, or something more primordial?
    *   Explain the ecological changes caused by the corruption and how it has evolved over centuries.
    *   Detail the attempts by various kingdoms and organizations to explore or colonize the Crimson Wilderness and their ultimate failures.
    *   Write about the "Corruption Touched" - individuals who have survived corruption and the strange abilities and madness that come with it.
