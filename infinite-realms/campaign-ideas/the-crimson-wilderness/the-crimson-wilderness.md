## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the horror of isolation, the corruption of nature, and the terrible price of survival. The central conflict is not just against the corrupted wilderness, but against the corruption that begins to infect the players themselves.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Corruption Points System**
*   Players track "Corruption Points" representing the wilderness's influence on their minds and bodies.
*   Corruption Points provide mechanical benefits (enhanced abilities, resistance to environmental hazards) but also drawbacks (madness effects, physical mutations, social penalties).
*   Players can spend Corruption Points for temporary power surges or save them for crucial moments, but accumulating too many triggers permanent changes to their characters.

### 2. **Survival Mechanics**
*   The wilderness enforces realistic survival needs: food, water, shelter, and rest become critical resources.
*   Weather events, wildlife encounters, and environmental hazards create ongoing challenges that require creative problem-solving.
*   The party must manage their physical and mental health, with exhaustion, hunger, and fear affecting their combat and social abilities.

### 3. **The Crimson Map**
*   The players create and maintain a map of the wilderness as they explore, revealing that the corruption is slowly changing the landscape around them.
*   Landmarks move, new hazards appear, and safe paths become dangerous, forcing the players to constantly adapt their understanding of the environment.
*   The map becomes a critical tool for navigation and a record of how the corruption is spreading.
