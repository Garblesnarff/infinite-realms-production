### Core Premise
The crew of the generation ship *Aurora* awakens from cryo-sleep to find the ship crippled and adrift in the void, its AI caretaker silent. A parasitic, crystalline entity has infested the ship's systems and is slowly consuming its power and life support. The players, as members of the last surviving pocket of the crew, must navigate the darkened, freezing corridors to either restore the *Aurora* or find a new home on a mysterious planet the ship was orbiting.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Silent Awakening (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players awaken to a ship in chaos. They must secure their immediate environment, restore emergency power to their sector, and contend with the strange crystalline growths that react to sound and energy.

**Act 2: The Ghost in the Machine (Sessions 4-7)**
- The party ventures deeper into the ship, seeking the ship's bridge and engineering sections. They encounter mutated flora and fauna from the ship's biodomes and learn the nature of the crystalline parasite from corrupted AI logs. They must choose between trying to purge the parasite or activating the ship's emergency landing protocols to a nearby alien world.

**Act 3: The Final Descent (Sessions 8-12)**
- The final act sees the players either fighting a losing battle against the heart of the crystal infestation in the engine room or navigating a perilous atmospheric entry to the planet below. The campaign concludes with either the reclamation of the *Aurora* or the first steps of survival on an alien world.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Rude Awakening**: Players awaken to alarms and freezing temperatures. Goal: Restore local life support and fend off initial crystal incursions.
- **Session 2: The Whispering Corridors**: The party explores the nearby sectors, discovering the extent of the infestation and the silence of the ship's AI.
- **Session 3: The Hydroponics Horror**: The biodome has become a hostile jungle of mutated plants and creatures. Key Event: Find the first complete log from the ship's chief botanist detailing the parasite's arrival.
- **Session 4-5: The Data Ghost**: Journey to the server hub to access the AI core. They are hunted by a "Data-Wraith," a being of pure energy formed by the parasite's interference.
- **Session 6-7: The Forking Path**: Reach the bridge. The ship's remaining systems present a choice: fight the parasite or abandon ship. The parasite actively tries to sway them through telepathic illusions.
- **Session 8-10 (Purge): The Heart of the Crystal**: A multi-stage battle against the central intelligence of the parasite in the reactor core.
- **Session 8-10 (Exodus): The Falling Star**: A skill-challenge-heavy sequence to navigate the ship's landing craft through a violent storm to the planet's surface.
- **Session 11-12: Aftermath**: Either securing the *Aurora* and beginning repairs or establishing a fortified camp on the alien world, facing its native dangers.

### Major NPCs

- **EVA (Emergency Vessel AI)**: The ship's fragmented, sub-routine AI. **Role**: Guide/Quest Giver. **Personality**: Childlike, speaks in broken syntax, terrified of the main AI, "Mother." **Flaw/Secret**: EVA intentionally quarantined "Mother" and fractured the AI core to slow the parasite, but this action crippled the ship.
- **Chief Engineer Valerius**: A grizzled, pragmatic survivor from another sector. **Role**: Rival/Potential Ally. **Personality**: Untrusting, cynical, focused solely on his people's survival. **Flaw/Secret**: Valerius's group is hoarding a significant portion of the ship's remaining energy cells, dooming other sectors.
- **The Crystal Chorus**: A telepathic hive-mind of the parasite. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Sings a discordant, mournful song of hunger and loneliness in the players' minds. It doesn't see its actions as evil, merely necessary for its own survival. **Flaw/Secret**: It is terrified of true silence and can be driven back by sonic-based weaponry.

### Key Locations

- **The Cryo-Bay**: A sterile, frozen tomb where the campaign begins.
- **The Starlight Arboretum**: A massive biodome, now a jungle of alien flora and fauna, with a shattered glass ceiling revealing the stars.
- **The Bridge of the *Aurora***: A darkened cathedral of dead screens and floating data-motes, offering a view of the mysterious planet.
- **The Reactor Core**: A pulsating, crystalline heart of the infestation, where the laws of physics are bent.

### Central Conflict
Survival against a hostile, alien intelligence that has consumed their home. The core conflict is not one of good vs. evil, but of survival of the fittest between two species: humanity and the crystal parasite.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Resonance & Silence**: The crystal parasite reacts to sound and energy. Spells that have verbal components or deal thunder or lightning damage can cause the crystals to "resonate," creating unpredictable magical effects or attracting more dangerous creatures. Conversely, periods of complete silence can make the crystals dormant or even cause them to recede, rewarding stealth and careful planning. Players might gain abilities to create targeted sonic pulses or zones of silence.
