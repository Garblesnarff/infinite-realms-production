## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A classic noir investigation with a fairy-tale twist.

*   **Act I — The First Slipper (Sessions 1–2):** The party investigates the latest crime: the Three Little Pigs' magically demolished brick house. They find the slipper and must dive into Everafter's seedy underbelly, shaking down informants like the Gingerbread Man and the Big Bad Wolf.
*   **Act II — A Tangled Web (Sessions 3–5):** The investigation points towards a conspiracy involving Cinderella, now a ruthless baroness of the glass industry, her embittered stepsisters, and a Fairy Godmother running a magical protection racket. The party must untangle the lies to find out who is the real culprit and who is being framed.
*   **Act III — The Stroke of Midnight (Sessions 6–8):** The party races against the clock to the Royal Ball, where they believe the Slipper-Killer will make their final move. They must expose the villain in a room full of Everafter's most powerful figures before the Prince himself becomes the final victim.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Prince Charmington IV** — *The Client*
    *   **Role:** The handsome, wealthy, and profoundly dim-witted prince who hires the party.
    *   **Personality:** Vain, charming, and utterly oblivious to the real problems of his city. He is more concerned with how the crimes will affect the guest list for his ball than with justice.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is secretly in debt to the Fairy Godmother, a fact that could ruin his family's reputation.

2.  **Cinderella, the Glass Baroness** — *The Red Herring*
    *   **Role:** The former scullery maid, now a cold and ruthless businesswoman who clawed her way to the top of Everafter society.
    *   **Personality:** Sharp, calculating, and trusts no one. She sees everything as a transaction and has no time for sentimentality.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is being blackmailed by one of her stepsisters, who knows the truth about how she *really* got to the ball on that fateful night (it involved some magical corporate espionage).

3.  **"Big Bad" Wolf** — *The Informant*
    *   **Role:** A reformed ex-convict who now works as a world-weary bouncer at "The Crooked Man," a tavern frequented by the city's less-savory characters.
    *   **Personality:** Gruff, cynical, and speaks in a low growl. He's seen it all and is not impressed by the party, but he has a soft spot for Little Red, his estranged granddaughter.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He took the fall for a crime committed by the Woodsman years ago and still holds a grudge.

## Central Conflict

This is a story about the rot that festers beneath a "happily ever after" facade. The central conflict is a classic whodunit, forcing the players to use their wits more than their swords. They must navigate a web of lies, blackmail, and old grudges where everyone has a motive and no one is what they seem.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Clue Board**
*   The DM maintains a shared "clue board" (using a virtual whiteboard or physical corkboard). As the party gathers evidence—a testimony, a physical object, a location—it gets added to the board.
*   Players can spend a short rest to try and connect two or more clues. If they propose a logical connection (e.g., "The cinder-stain on the slipper matches the soot from the Godmother's pumpkin-incinerator"), the DM grants them a **Moment of Insight**.
*   A Moment of Insight can be spent to gain advantage on one investigation-related ability check (Insight, Investigation, Perception) or to unlock a new, specific line of questioning with an NPC.

### 2. **Press the Witness**
*   Major interrogations are run as a form of social combat. Instead of HP, a key NPC has a **Composure** score.
*   Players use their social skills as "attacks." A successful Persuasion check might deal 1d6 Composure damage, while a clever use of Intimidation with evidence might deal 1d10.
*   Reducing an NPC's Composure to 0 forces them to reveal a critical secret. However, using the wrong approach (e.g., Intimidating a prideful character) might cause them to "Clam Up," raising their Composure and making them harder to crack.
