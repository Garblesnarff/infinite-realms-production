## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat will be short, sharp, and deadly. The party will face skilled assassins, duplicitous courtiers, and the city guard. However, many conflicts can and should be resolved through diplomacy, blackmail, or stealth.
*   **Investigation:** The heart of the campaign is the investigation. The party will need to gather clues, interrogate suspects, and piece together the puzzle of the poisoning. This will require a mix of social skills, deductive reasoning, and a willingness to get their hands dirty.
*   **Consequences:** The party's actions will have a significant impact on the balance of power in Vesper. A false accusation could lead to a duel, a diplomatic incident, or even a gang war. The party must tread carefully, as a single misstep could be their last.
