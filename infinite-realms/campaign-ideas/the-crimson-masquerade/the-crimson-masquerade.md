# The Crimson Masquerade

## Real-World Basis: The Dancing Plague of 1518
In Strasbourg, Alsace, a woman named Frau Troffea began to dance fervently in the street. Within a month, she was joined by over 400 others. With no explanation, these people danced for days without rest, many dying from heart attacks, strokes, or sheer exhaustion. Physicians of the time blamed "hot blood," but no one truly knows what caused the mass hysteria.

## D&D Twist
The "plague" is a magical curse, a ritualistic infection spread by an unheard, mind-altering melody. The curse is the work of a hidden cult dedicated to a forgotten Demon Lord of endless, agonizing revelry (such as a lesser aspect of Graz'zt or a new entity). The non-stop dancing is not just madness; it is a grand ritual. Each exhausted, dying dancer's soul is a thread in a tapestry of suffering, slowly weakening the veil between the Material Plane and the Abyss.

## Campaign Premise (Urban Mystery/Social Horror)
The players arrive in a major city (such as Waterdeep, Sharn, or a large homebrew metropolis) during what appears to be a joyous festival. However, they soon notice the manic, desperate energy. The dancers' feet are bloody, their faces masks of ecstatic pain. They cannot stop. The City Watch is overwhelmed, and traditional clerics find their healing spells only suppress the symptoms temporarily. The players must investigate the source of the dancing plague, forcing them to delve into the city's underbelly. They might consult with Bardic colleges to analyze the cursed melody, seek aid from cloistered monasteries to fight the psychic influence, or track the cult through the chaotic, dancing streets. The campaign culminates in a race against time to disrupt the cult's grand masquerade before the entire city dances itself into the Abyss.

## Key Elements
*   **The Melody of Madness:** The curse is a song that can't be unheard. Players may need to make Wisdom saving throws to resist its effects as they get closer to the source. Finding a way to counter or silence this melody is a primary goal.
*   **A City in Chaos:** The adventure is set in a single city, but one that is devolving into madness. Social encounters are unpredictable, safe havens are few, and the streets are a constant, swirling obstacle course of flailing bodies.
*   **The Cult of the Final Dance:** The antagonists are not cackling villains but true believers who see the agonizing dance as a form of divine ecstasy. They hide in plain sight among the revelers, protecting the ritual's focal points.
*   **Planar Bleeding:** As the ritual progresses, the city begins to change. Colors become more vibrant and unsettling, strange demonic creatures are seen in the corner of one's eye, and the laws of physics begin to fray in the oldest parts of the city.

## Tone
*The Masque of the Red Death* meets *Footloose*. A tense urban mystery where the threat is both magical and psychological, combining investigation with the social horror of a society collapsing in on itself with a smile.
