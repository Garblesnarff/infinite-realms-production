# Creative Brief: The Codex of Lost Tomorrows

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Surrealist Narrative Illustration (Varo/Carrington-inspired)

Inspired by the intricate, dreamlike, and symbolic art of surrealist painters like Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington, with a focus on books and narrative elements. This style aims to capture the wondrous, uncanny, whimsical, melancholic, and mind-bending tone of "The Codex of Lost Tomorrows," where a gargantuan library contains entire timelines as books, and reality is shaped by narrative magic.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Narrative as Reality:** Describe scenes where the elements of a story (pages, ink, marginalia, plot points) are tangible and interact with the characters.
*   **Symbolism and Allegory:** Focus on how abstract concepts (memories, futures, emotions) can be visually represented through objects or environmental details.
*   **Intricate Detail and Hidden Meanings:** Scenes should be rich with small, often symbolic, details that reward close inspection and contribute to the overall mystery.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Wondrous, uncanny, whimsical, melancholic, mind-bending, surreal, narrative, symbolic, intricate, ethereal.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of quiet awe and intellectual curiosity, mixed with a subtle melancholy for lost possibilities. The atmosphere should be one of profound mystery and the delicate balance of countless stories.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Highly detailed and intricate linework, reminiscent of classical illustration, but with a surreal twist. Lines are precise for architectural elements and book details, but can be fluid and organic for dreamlike or magical effects. 
*   **Forms:** Characters are realistically rendered but can be subtly elongated or distorted. Environments are often grand and architectural, but with impossible or shifting elements. Books themselves are central, appearing as colossal structures or miniature worlds.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in the style of Remedios Varo. The focus is on a scholar meticulously repairing a torn page, where the tear reveals a miniature, vibrant world within the book, complete with tiny figures and landscapes."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich, muted, and often earthy tones, reminiscent of aged paper, old leather, and deep wood for the library itself. These are contrasted with luminous, ethereal glows for magical effects, narrative energy, and the vibrant, often fantastical, colors of the book-worlds.
*   **Melancholy:** A subtle undertone of desaturated blues and grays can convey the melancholic aspect of lost futures.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a rich color palette of aged parchment browns and deep library greens, with a luminous, ethereal glow emanating from the pages of an open book, revealing a vibrant, miniature world within."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are realistically proportioned, often depicted as scholars, adventurers, or librarians, with a sense of quiet determination or intellectual curiosity. Their clothing is practical but can have subtle, elegant details.
*   **Archivist:** Should appear as a figure of quiet power and profound sadness, perhaps with eyes that reflect countless stories.
*   **Book-World Inhabitants:** Can vary wildly in style, from fantastical creatures to ordinary people, but always with a subtle hint that they are part of a larger narrative.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An Errant Binding, a figure in a practical, leather-bound suit, stands at the edge of a colossal, open book. Their face is illuminated by the soft, internal glow of the pages, which depict a vibrant, miniature city."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The Codex itself is a gargantuan, ethereal library with endless spirals of shelves, living aisles, and reading pools. Book-worlds are diverse, ranging from fantastical landscapes to mundane cities, but always with a subtle narrative logic.
*   **Atmosphere:** Quiet, contemplative, and often filled with the rustle of pages and the faint whispers of countless stories. The air might shimmer with narrative energy.
*   **Details:** Sentient scrolls, ink-stained pathways, shelves that hum, and the subtle visual cues of a world where stories are tangible (e.g., a character walking on a line of text, a cloud shaped like a thought bubble).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view inside the Codex, a vast, ethereal library with endless spirals of towering bookshelves that disappear into a luminous, cosmic void. Pages float like rivers through the air, and distant figures can be seen navigating the literary landscape."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, diffused, and often ethereal lighting, creating a sense of wonder and mystery. Light sources can be internal (glowing pages, narrative energy) or external (a distant, unseen sun).
*   **Shadows:** Soft and subtle, used to define form and create depth, rather than to obscure. Shadows can also be symbolic, representing erased futures or forgotten memories.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of wonder, highlight the magical nature of the library, and emphasize the delicate balance of countless stories.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the soft, internal glow of countless luminous pages, casting a warm, ethereal light on the surrounding shelves. The lighting emphasizes the magical and wondrous nature of the library."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, expansive shots to emphasize the vastness of the Codex and the book-worlds. Can also use tight, intricate shots to focus on symbolic details or the act of reading/writing.
*   **Techniques:** Employ forced perspective to highlight the scale of the library. Frame characters within the pages of a book or against a backdrop of swirling text. Use leading lines (e.g., rows of shelves, lines of text) to guide the eye. Visual metaphors (e.g., a character literally climbing a ladder of success) should be integrated compositionally.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a character standing at the edge of a colossal, open book, its pages stretching into the distance like a vast landscape. The composition emphasizes the scale of the book-world and the character's journey into the narrative."

## Voice

A soft, ageless, female voice, like the gentle rustle of ancient, brittle pages turning in a vast, silent library. Her whispery timbre is clear and ethereal, with a slow and deliberate pacing that conveys the immense weight of forgotten knowledge and countless stories. The emotion is a profound, melancholic wisdom, a quiet awe for the infinite possibilities of narrative, and a subtle, underlying sadness for lost futures. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, ambient hum and the faint, almost imperceptible, sound of shimmering narrative energy. Role: The voice of the Archivist, the guardian of the Codex, or the disembodied voice of the library itself, whispering its secrets across time.
