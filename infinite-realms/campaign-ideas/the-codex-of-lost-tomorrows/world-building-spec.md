### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Codex of Lost Tomorrows**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The world should be wondrous, uncanny, and based on narrative logic.
*   **Content:** In a gargantuan, aetherial library known as the Codex, entire timelines exist as books. When pages begin to vanish, erasing possible futures, the players are recruited as "Errant Bindings"—adventurers who can step into books. They must mend plot-leaks, rescue erased characters, and outwit a shadowy archivist who is rewriting reality for unknown, tragic reasons.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the origin of the Codex. Who or what created it, and for what purpose?
    *   Explain the mechanics of "narrative magic." How can stories be tangible, and how can they be entered and altered?
    *   Write the history of the Conservators and the Rewriters, and the philosophical schism that divides them.
    *   Describe the nature of an "echo-shade" and a "script-ghost."
    *   Detail the backstory of the Archivist, Peridot Stave, and the great catastrophe they are trying to prevent.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Conservators** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To preserve all possible futures and protect the integrity of the Codex.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A loose network of scholars and librarians, with senior members like Aisling Quillroot acting as mentors.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To maintain the Codex and assist readers.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Aisling is hiding her own past transgression of erasing a painful future, which makes her sympathetic to the Archivist.
        *   **Assets:** Deep knowledge of the Codex, access to restricted sections, the ability to mend torn pages.
        *   **Relationships:** The players' patrons; ideologically opposed to the Rewriters and the Archivist.
    *   **The Rewriters** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To empower sentient beings by giving them the ability to edit their own fates.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A radical, decentralized faction led by the idealistic Scribe-General Velo.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To bring narrative freedom to all.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To seize control of the "Archivist's Pen" to make their philosophy the fundamental law of the Codex.
        *   **Assets:** A network of spies, the ability to create forgeries and false narratives, a fanatical belief in their cause.
        *   **Relationships:** A rival faction that may try to recruit or use the players.
    *   **The Archivist (Peridot Stave)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To protect the multiverse from a catastrophic future by excising all timelines that lead to it.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A single, powerful individual.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None. They operate in secret.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To save a specific person they love from a terrible fate, at the cost of erasing countless innocent futures.
        *   **Assets:** The Archivist's Pen (a powerful reality-editing tool), deep knowledge of the Codex's inner workings, the ability to create redactions.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonist, but with a tragic and potentially sympathetic motivation.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Aisling Quillroot:** The warm, absent-minded, and guilt-ridden Conservator who acts as the party's mentor.
    *   **The Archivist (Peridot Stave):** The measured, melancholic, and morally convinced antagonist.
    *   **Scribe-General Velo:** The idealistic and dogmatic leader of the Rewriters.
    *   **Tomekeeper Jory:** A literal, earnest, and friendly living book who can act as an ally.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Sentient Scroll (Creature)"
    *   "Echo-Shade (Creature)"
    *   "Marginalia Imp (Creature)"
    *   "Ambitious Rewriter Agent"
    *   "Confused character from a redacted timeline"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Margins Market:** A bazaar in the gutters and margins of giant books, where dealers sell unwritten scenes and stolen epilogues.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The stall of the whisper-broker, the ink-merchant's stand, the bindery where new identities are forged, a tavern made from a hollowed-out dictionary.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Fae-like couriers (Moths), rival Errant Bindings, dealers in narrative contraband, forgotten characters.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Stolen plot hooks, unwritten scenes, forged character backstories, rare inks with magical properties.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** The party is offered a page from their own future, a deal goes bad and a chase ensues across the page-tops, a character from a book the party previously visited recognizes them, a Rewriter agent tries to recruit them, a patrol of Librarian Wardens raids the market.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Archivist buys a special, un-erasable ink from a merchant here." "You can buy a character's happy ending, but it has to be stolen from someone else." "There's a map to the Codex's spine hidden in the footnotes of a forgotten book."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (A chaotic market on the edge of giant pages, words forming the floor and ceiling), Sound (A constant murmur of bartering and whispers, the rustle of paper), Smell (Old paper, fresh ink, ozone).
    *   **A Book-World: The City That Forgets Tomorrow:** A city where citizens wake into different lives each morning due to a narrative instability.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Unchanging Clocktower, the Shifting Tavern, the Library of Yesterday's Memories, the home of the one citizen who remains the same.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Confused citizens who don't notice the changes, time-warped constables who enforce the current day's laws, a single, anchored individual.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Varies wildly from day to day.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A player wakes up to find they are the city guard captain for the day, a law has changed overnight making something the party is carrying illegal, an NPC they befriended yesterday is now their sworn enemy, a building they were in yesterday no longer exists, a memory-thief is seen stealing a citizen's consistent thread.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The person who remains the same each day is the key to stabilizing the city." "The city's instability is a side effect of the Archivist testing a new redaction method." "The Clocktower is the anchor of the book; fixing it will fix the city."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (A confusing mishmash of architectural styles, people in constantly changing clothes), Sound (A cacophony of different sounds that shift and change), Smell (Constantly, unnervingly changing).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players enter a book-world.
    *   **THEN:** The rules of that world's narrative logic temporarily override physics. Generate a list of 3-5 "Story Rules" for that book (e.g., "In this tragedy, no one can tell the whole truth," "In this comedy, no one can be permanently harmed").
    *   **IF:** The players successfully restore an erased future.
    *   **THEN:** They gain an "Echo Token." Generate a short, heartwarming scene showing the positive outcome of the restored future.
    *   **IF:** The players are witnessed by the Archivist altering a timeline.
    *   **THEN:** The Archivist triggers a "Narrative Twist." Generate an unexpected rule change in the current book-world that complicates the players' mission (e.g., gravity reverses, a friendly NPC is revealed to be a traitor).
    *   **IF:** The players choose to help the Rewriters instead of the Conservators on a key mission.
    *   **THEN:** They gain a powerful ability to temporarily rewrite a minor detail in a scene, but their relationship with their mentor, Aisling, is damaged, and she will withhold crucial information in the future.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players choose to take the Archivist's Pen for themselves.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the players now have the power to rewrite reality. They must contend with the very catastrophe the Archivist was trying to prevent, and they become the new guardians (or tyrants) of the Codex, hunted by all other factions.
