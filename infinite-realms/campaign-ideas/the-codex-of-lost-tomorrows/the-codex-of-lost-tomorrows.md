The Codex of Lost Tomorrows

A High-Magical / Surreal campaign — Full Campaign (10–13 sessions) — Medium difficulty

Campaign Overview

Title: The Codex of Lost Tomorrows
Campaign Type / Genre: High Fantasy with surreal, metafictional elements (books-as-worlds / narrative-magic)
Estimated Length: Full Campaign — 10–13 sessions (each 3–4 hours)
Player Level Range: Start 1 → Finish 11–12
Tone (keywords): wondrous, uncanny, whimsical, melancholic, mind-bending
Core Premise (2–4 sentences):
A gargantuan, aetherial library — the Codex — contains entire timelines, lives, and futures as books. When pages start disappearing, entire possible futures blink out of existence. The party are recruited (or accidentally bound) as Errant Bindings — adventurers who can step into books to mend plot-leaks, rescue erased people, and outwit a shadowy archivist who’s rewriting reality for reasons unknown.

What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

Encounters: Balanced mix: roleplay-heavy sessions with one or two medium combats (CR ~1–6 early, scaling to CR ~7–10).

Puzzles/Survival: High emphasis on lateral thinking and narrative puzzles — think “fix the story” challenges.

Consequences: Failure removes minor future possibilities (mechanical: lose a party flashback, give NPCs altered memories), but not permanent PC deletion unless they risk it intentionally.

Story Arc (Full Campaign — 10–13 sessions)

Three major Acts with two mid-arc pivots and optional epilogues.

Act I — The Library’s Whisper (Sessions 1–3): Recruit + introductory book-delve(s). Establish rules: entering books, narrative logic, and that erased pages equal lost futures.

Act II — Worlds Unbound (Sessions 4–8): Multiple book-world missions reveal patterns: someone is “redacting” possibility. The party meets factions: Conservators, Rewriters, and Free-Readers. Allies and enemies shift as narrative truths emerge.

Act III — The Archivist’s Pen (Sessions 9–11): Confront the mastermind within the Codex’s heart. Final multi-layered confrontation across stacked book-realities with metafictional stakes.

Epilogue & Aftermath (Sessions 12–13 optional): Reweaving futures, consequences of the party’s choices — leave hooks for sequels or let players write their own chapter.

Session-by-Session Outline
Session 1 — “Dustbound”

Focus: Social / Tutorial / Light exploration

Key Events:

Hook: PCs saved from a reality collapse in their hometown when a page blinks out mid-sentence.

Meet Mentor: an eccentric Conservator (Aisling) who recruits them as Errant Bindings.

Learn Rule: How book-entry works (runes, ink, marginalia).

Mini-delve: A Café in Midnight — a short book-world to teach mechanics and stakes (a missing page erases a barista’s smile permanently).

Session 2 — “A Tale of Two Plays”

Focus: Investigation / Roleplay / Puzzle

Key Events:

Investigate the Guild of Scribes; find the first clue: a blacked-out marginal note signed “—P.”

Infiltrate a theatrical book where an actor’s role has been removed. Fix the script to stabilize reality (skill challenge: Performance + Insight + Charisma checks).

Encounter: Script-ghosts (phantasmal actors) that enforce dramatic beats.

Session 3 — “The Shelf that Hums”

Focus: Exploration / Social / Combat

Key Events:

Travel to a living shelf — a sentient aisle that rearranges itself.

Combat: Animated volumes (use homunculus/animate object reskins + illusion hazards).

Find: map to the Codex’s “Third Spiral” and a coded ledger hinting at the Archivist’s motive.

Session 4 — “The Garden of Foretold Rain”

Focus: Book-world Quest / Moral Choice

Key Events:

Enter an eco-fable: townsfolk plant maps-of-rain to produce weather. Someone’s pages were stolen; drought is becoming permanent.

Moral choice: Return stolen rain pages to revive a tyrant’s childhood or keep them to free a village from oppression. Consequences ripple.

Session 5 — “Margins & Mutiny”

Focus: Social / Stealth / Faction politics

Key Events:

Meet the Rewriters (radical faction). Debate ethics.

Heist mission: break into the Archive Vault to retrieve a ledger — stealth or all-out brawl.

Revelation: The “redactions” are not random — they remove futures that would have doomed a person the Archivist loves.

Session 6 — “A City That Forgets Tomorrow”

Focus: Investigation / Urban survival / Puzzle

Key Events:

Book-world: a city whose citizens wake into different lives each morning (day-shifted realities). Players must navigate shifting laws/lingo.

Puzzle: Patchwork legality riddle — to anchor a citizen, find their consistent thread across realities.

Combat: Time-warped constables. Clue: fabric of the Codex is wearing thin here.

Session 7 — “Ink & Echoes”

Focus: Dungeon-crawl / Heavy combat / Ritual mechanic introduced

Key Events:

Delve into a corrupted codex spine — labyrinthine stacks filled with echoing versions of the PCs (echo-shades).

Introduce Echo Tokens (mechanic): defeating echoes restores lost memory-pages.

Boss: A Librarian Warden (reskinned iron golem + psychic attacks).

Session 8 — “The Pen’s Family”

Focus: Roleplay / Revelation

Key Events:

Meet the Archivist (first contact; non-hostile). Learn their backstory: they are trying to excise futures that would create a multiversal catastrophe — but their method kills countless innocents.

Offer: one last bargain — rewrite a single book to avert catastrophe but risk unleashing the harm the Archivist fears.

Session 9 — “Stacked Realities”

Focus: Multi-reality set-piece / Skill challenge / Split-party options

Key Events:

Final plan: the party must simultaneously operate in three books (split scenes) to either stop the Archivist, reweave the Codex’s logic, or take the Archivist’s Pen.

Skill challenges and combat across linked maps; failing in one book affects others.

Session 10 — “The Archivist’s Pen” (Climax)

Focus: Big combat + ritual / Metafictional puzzle

Key Events:

Confrontation with the Archivist — can be fought, reasoned with, or absorbed into the Codex.

Final ritual: The Rebinding — a contested set of skill rolls (Arcana, History, Persuasion, Performance) to stitch back erased futures or to claim authorship.

Session 11 — “Afterpages” (Resolution)

Focus: Epilogue / Fallout / NPC consequences

Key Events:

Map outcomes: which futures returned, which stayed dead, who remembers what.

Optional twist: a new blank book appears — the party’s own codex chapter; players decide to write, burn, or hand it to the Codex.

(Sessions 12–13 optional: expansion missions — hunt down rogue rewriters, build a branch library, or a sequel hook where the Pen is now sentient.)

Major NPCs (7)

Aisling Quillroot — Conservator (mentor)

Personality: warm, absent-minded, fierce about stories.

Motivation: preserve possibility and prevent authorial monopolies.

Secret/Flaw: once erased her own child’s painful future — guilt haunts her desk.

The Archivist (“P.” / Peridot Stave) — Antagonist / tragic figure

Personality: measured, melancholic, convinced of moral necessity.

Motivation: protect multiverse stability by removing catastrophic branches.

Secret/Flaw: their method destroys innocent timelines; they fear a specific future where everything dies (and someone dear to them suffers).

Moth (The Reader) — Fae-esque courier

Personality: playful, cryptic, loves riddles.

Motivation: chaos and collecting unread chapters.

Secret/Flaw: attracted to forbidden pages; may betray the party for a rarer chapter.

Scribe-General Velo — Head of the Rewriters

Personality: idealistic, dogmatic.

Motivation: empower people by letting them edit fate (freedom to edit one’s narrative).

Secret/Flaw: will erase a person without consent if it fits a “greater good” plan.

Edda of the Margins — Old marginalia-witch

Personality: sardonic, encyclopedic memory.

Motivation: catalog marginalia; she wants to preserve the margins — where the unexpected hides.

Secret/Flaw: her own notes are slowly becoming unreadable — she’s losing her place in time.

Tomekeeper Jory — Living book (NPC ally)

Personality: literal, earnest, learns idioms slowly.

Motivation: protect younger volumes and children’s stories.

Secret/Flaw: susceptible to flattery; damaged spine reveals a hidden map.

Rae “Inkfinger” Marr — Rival Errant Binding / gray-market editor

Personality: charismatic rogue, quick-witted.

Motivation: profit and thrills.

Secret/Flaw: owes a debt to the Rewriters; may switch sides.

Key Locations (6)

The Codex (Library Proper) — endless spirals of shelves, living aisles, reading pools. (Hub, safe zones, rules-heavy)

The Third Spiral — an ancient restricted ring where futures are archived. (Investigation & politics)

The Margins Market — a bazaar in the gutters of books: dealers sell unwritten scenes and stolen epilogues. (Social/side-quests)

Aisling’s Conservatory — sanctuary that grows story-vines; an NPC hub. (Safe haven + quest giver)

Book-world Examples:

The Rainless City: a novel-gap city where tomorrow never comes. (Urban puzzle)

The Play that Rewrites Its Actors: theatre-world where roles swap mid-speech. (Roleplay + combat)

The Pen-Heart — beating heart of the Codex, where the Archivist conducts the Rebinding. (Final arena)

Central Conflict

Main Tension: Who gets to author reality? The Archivist believes erasure prevents catastrophe; Rewriters and Free-Readers believe in the messy, dangerous freedom of possibility. The party must choose between stability (costly but safe), chaotic freedom (risky but liberating), or forging a third way (dangerous synthesis).

Side Quests (5)

Borrowed Childhoods: Return stolen childhood pages to a dying author to let them remember their son’s laugh once more. (Emotional choice.)

The Unwritten Heirloom: Retrieve a family’s ancestral chapter from the Margins Market before a collector burns it to make it “rare.”

Aisling’s Errand: Gather ink from a singing squid in a poetry-volume ocean to repair a torn binding. (Oddball fetch + roleplay.)

The Scribe’s Gambit: Help Rae con a Rewriter by staging a fake future; decide whether to double-cross Rae.

Echo Restoration: Hunt echo-shades in the Codex spine to restore an NPC’s lost memory (grants an Echo Token).

Unique Mechanics (Fits high-fantasy + surreal + medium)
1. Book-Entry Rules

PCs need a literal entry method to go into a book: a binding rune, a dipped quill, or a whispered title.

Inside a book, narrative logic temporarily overrides physics: metaphors can be literal (e.g., “climbing the ladder of success” becomes a ladder puzzle).

2. Echo Tokens

Earned by defeating echo-shades or recovering erased paragraphs. Spend to restore a lost memory, gain a narrative edge (auto-success on one roleplay scene), or rewind 1 turn in combat once.

3. Author’s Reach (Soft Meta)

The DM can introduce authorial constraints: once per session, the Archivist’s influence forces a “Narrative Twist” (an unexpected rule change in the book-world — e.g., gravity reverses). Players can spend Echo Tokens to resist.

4. Marginalia Skill Challenges

Players collect marginalia notes that grant passive bonuses (a margin note that “this person always lies” gives advantage on Insight for that NPC). These are limited-resource boons and encourage exploration.

5. Rewrite vs. Restore Choice

When encountering an erased future/person, party chooses to Restore (costly ritual, returns person as they were) or Rewrite (alter the person’s future, possibly creating a better life but introducing unpredictable side-effects). Both choices have mechanical consequences (Corruption-like narrative debt vs. immediate boon).

Encounters, Monsters & CR Guidance

Reskinned monsters: Echo-shades (use specter/phantom mechanics), Librarian Warden (stone servant / construct), Script-ghosts (use specter + performance debuffs), Marginal Imps (quasi-fey tricksters).

Bosses: Archivist (custom NPC: high-level wizard-like reality-bender with narrative spells), Scribe-General (battle strategist).

CR Guidance: Early sessions: CR 1–4. Mid: CR 5–7. Climax: CR 9–11 or lower with multi-layered environmental dangers (narrative shifts).

Rewards & Magic Items (Examples)

Quill of Errand-Binding (Rare): Bind a small promise into a creature. Once per long rest you can compel truth-telling for one minute. Using it on a sentient being risks attracting Rewriters.

Echo Locket (Uncommon): Store one short memory; later play it back to grant inspiration or answer a question. Lost if the Codex deletes the memory.

Pagecloak (Very Rare): Short teleportation by folding into a page — limited uses; if used in a corrupted book, roll on the Twist table.

Visual / Thumbnail Ideas (3 high-contrast, distinct concepts)

“Open the Codex” — Giant book opening with luminous pages like rivers. Silhouetted party stands at the edge of a page-river; title in elegant serif, gold/indigo palette, with a small black blot (hint of danger). Mood: epic wonder.

“The Archivist’s Pen” — Close-up of a massive pen with a shadowed figure reflected in its ink; tiny floating book-worlds swirl in the ink. Palette: deep black + luminous cyan. Mood: ominous and poetic.

“Marginalia Market” — Busy bazaar on the gutter of a giant page, stalls made from folded paper, characters bartering with bookmarks. Bright, chaotic color scheme; focus: whimsy and oddity.

(These prompts work straight into image generation or a thumbnail artist: include focal point, color palette, and one emotional keyword.)

DM Tips & Minimal Prep (Playable immediately)

Session zero (10–15 min): Set metafiction consent: players okay with reality-bending? Establish each PC’s narrative hook (a regret/future they want to protect).

Prep per session (20–40 minutes): Choose 1–2 book-world themes, sketch simple maps (3 rooms/scenes), pre-write 3 unique narrative twists.

Handouts: short book-summaries, a “ledger” page with marginalia clues, an illustrated Echo Token card.

Roleplay beats: encourage players to narrate small scenes within books — reward creativity with Echo Tokens.

Balance tip: favor creative solutions. Many problems can be solved by rewriting a scene rather than fighting; give mechanical benefits for elegant meta-solutions.

Multiple Endings (Examples)

The Conservator Victory (Restore): The party stops redactions, repairs the Codex’s ethics, and institutes a council of readers to democratically manage futures. Cost: several personal memories vanish to seal the fix (use Echo Tokens as cost).

The Rewriter Revolution (Rewrite): The party helps Rewriters empower people to edit their own fates — immediate freedom, long-term instability and unpredictable branching realities (new campaign hooks).

Archivist’s Mercy (Sacrifice): The Archivist is shown mercy and becomes part of the Codex — sacrifices their solitude to guard futures; the party must take on custodial roles (epilogue focuses on stewardship).

Claim the Pen (Power Ending): Party seizes authorship — rewrite their own chapter but become targets across all book-worlds (sets up dark sequel).

Catastrophe (Fail): Redactions cascade; many minor realities blink out. Surviving PCs must rebuild among the ashes of unmade tomorrows.

Quick Start — 10-minute Tabletop Boot

Session zero: explain rules; each player names one possible future they fear losing.

Immediate Hook: Start during a small-town fair where a juggler’s entire act disappears mid-performance — someone’s future erased.

First Goal: Meet Aisling and enter “A Café in Midnight” (mini-delve tutorial).

Player Handouts: A ledger piece with the signature “—P.”, an Echo Token physical token, and a short rule-sheet for book-entry.

Optional Hooks & Future Expansion

A war between libraries (Codex vs. Underground Archive).

A campaign arc where players become living books — play one-shot sessions inside player-written stories.

Political drama as mortal governments seek to weaponize pages — epic stakes beyond the Codex.
