# Creative Brief: The Labyrinth of Slumber

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Whimsical Surrealist Painting

Inspired by the iconic surrealist painters like Salvador Dalí and René Magritte, but infused with a vibrant, dream-like quality that can shift between whimsical and nightmarish. This style aims to capture the fluid, psychological, and often contradictory nature of the dream world, where belief shapes reality and emotions manifest physically.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Embrace the Impossible:** Describe scenes that defy logic and physics. Objects should float, melt, or transform in unexpected ways.
*   **Symbolism and Metaphor:** Think about the underlying meaning of elements. How can an emotion or an idea be visually represented?
*   **Fluidity and Transformation:** Emphasize elements that are not static but are in a state of change or flux.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Surreal, whimsical, nightmarish, mysterious, psychological, dreamlike, fluid, symbolic, ethereal.
*   **Feeling:** A world of infinite possibilities and profound anxieties. A sense of wonder mixed with unease. The atmosphere should be both inviting and subtly threatening, reflecting the dual nature of dreams.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic rendering of impossible forms. Lines are often soft and flowing, but can become sharp and angular for nightmarish elements. Forms are often distorted, elongated, or fragmented.
*   **Textures:** Smooth, ethereal textures for dream-like elements (e.g., clouds, water, skin). Rough, unsettling textures for nightmarish manifestations (e.g., gnarled wood, cracked earth, grotesque flesh).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in the style of whimsical surrealism. The focus is on a melting clock draped over a tree branch, with a soft, ethereal glow emanating from its face."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Highly varied and often contrasting. Can shift from serene pastels and soft gradients for whimsical scenes to vivid, almost neon hues for intense emotions, and then to muted, unsettling tones for nightmarish sequences.
*   **Emotional Resonance:** Colors should directly reflect the emotional state of the dreamscape. Bright, hopeful colors for areas of shared joy; dark, desaturated colors for areas of fear or grief.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant and contrasting color palette, with a serene pastel sky melting into a vivid, swirling magenta ocean, under a sky where two moons hang like pearls."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters can range from realistically rendered figures to highly stylized, almost abstract representations of emotions or ideas. Proportions can be fluid and change based on context.
*   **Dream-Natives:** Entities like the Sandman should be ethereal, whimsical, and slightly ambiguous. Nightmarish creatures (the Bogeyman) should be grotesque, shadowy, and physically imposing, often with distorted features.
*   **Player Characters:** Should retain a sense of their waking-world identity, but with subtle dream-like alterations (e.g., slightly glowing eyes, flowing hair that defies gravity).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A figure with a serene, almost translucent face, floating above a landscape of impossible geometry. Their clothes ripple as if underwater, and their eyes glow with a soft, internal light."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Landscapes are impossible and ever-shifting. Mountains might be made of books, oceans of tears, or forests of whispering faces. Architecture can be grand and classical, but with impossible angles or floating elements.
*   **Atmosphere:** Often hazy, ethereal, or filled with strange, glowing particles. The environment itself is alive and reactive to the emotions and thoughts of the dreamers.
*   **Details:** Clocks without hands, doors leading to nowhere, reflections that show different realities, objects that change size or shape when not observed directly.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A vast, serene meadow where giant, luminous dandelions float upwards into a sky filled with swirling galaxies. In the distance, a classical Greek temple floats upside down above a sea of glass."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Soft, diffused, and often ethereal lighting for whimsical scenes. Harsh, dramatic, and often unnatural lighting for nightmarish sequences. Light sources can be internal (glowing objects, characters) or external (multiple suns, a single, piercing beam).
*   **Shadows:** Shadows can be long and distorted, or completely absent. They can also be sentient or take on symbolic forms.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of wonder, mystery, or dread. It can highlight the surreal nature of the environment.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by a soft, internal glow emanating from the ground, casting long, distorted shadows of the characters that stretch into infinity. The lighting is ethereal and dreamlike."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, expansive shots to emphasize the vastness and impossibility of the dreamscape. Can also use tight, claustrophobic compositions for moments of psychological tension.
*   **Techniques:** Employ distorted perspectives, impossible angles, and a sense of floating or weightlessness. Frame characters against vast, symbolic backdrops. Use repetition of elements to create a hypnotic or unsettling effect.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, panoramic shot of a character standing on a tiny island in a sea of lost memories, with giant, weeping eyes floating in the sky above. The composition emphasizes the character's isolation and the vastness of the dream."

## Voice

A soft, ethereal, and slightly echoing gender-neutral voice, like a half-remembered dream or a whisper carried on a gentle breeze through a field of slumbering thoughts. The timbre is clear and fluid, with a slow and deliberate pacing that drifts between moments of serene beauty and subtle, unsettling unease. The emotion is a profound blend of gentle wonder, a deep, underlying melancholy for forgotten memories, and a pervasive sense of the infinite, shifting possibilities of the dream world. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, shimmering, chorus-like effect and the faint, ambient sound of distant, dream-like music. Role: The voice of the Sandman, the guardian of the dreamscape, or the disembodied voice of the Labyrinth itself, guiding or misguiding lost souls.
