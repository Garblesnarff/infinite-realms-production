A magical sleeping sickness, the "Somnus Plague," has swept through the kingdom, trapping its victims in a shared, collective dream. The players are "Dream-Walkers," rare individuals with the power to project their minds into this subconscious realm. They must navigate the Labyrinth of Slumber—a bizarre, ever-shifting landscape of shared desires and nightmares—to find the plague's source and awaken the sleepers. But in a world where belief shapes reality, they must also battle living metaphors and weaponized emotions, and risk losing their own minds to the dream.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions)

A rescue mission into the collective unconscious.

*   **Act I — The First Dream (Sessions 1–3):** The party enters the dreamscape for the first time to rescue a key figure—the Queen's chief advisor. They must learn the surreal "rules" of the dream world, where physics are fluid and confidence is a weapon, while evading the dream's natural defenses.
*   **Act II — The Nightmare Architect (Sessions 4–7):** The party discovers the dreamscape is not random; it is being shaped by a powerful "Nightmare Architect." They must travel through different "districts" of the dream—the anxiety-ridden Merchant's Guild, the paranoid Guard Barracks—to find clues to the Architect's identity and location in the waking world.
*   **Act III — Waking the City (Sessions 8–12):** The party identifies the Architect: a lonely, phenomenally powerful child psychic who has unintentionally drawn the kingdom into their dream to escape a personal tragedy. The party must confront the child in the heart of the dream—a twisted, nightmarish version of a royal nursery—and either sever the connection by force or help the child face their grief to peacefully end the plague.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Gates of Horn and Ivory”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Surreal Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party is hired and undergoes the ritual to enter the dreamscape for the first time.
    *   They awaken in the "Arrival Meadow," a serene but unsettlingly perfect field.
    *   They must learn to navigate the dream, where their expectations can alter their surroundings, and they are guided by a mysterious, dream-native entity.
**Escalation:** The serene meadow gives way to a forest of whispering trees that manifest the party's own insecurities, their first taste of the dream's psychological dangers.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Marketplace of Anxiety”
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Social
*   **Key Events:**
    *   To find the Queen's advisor, the party must travel to the dream-manifestation of the city's marketplace.
    *   Here, the collective anxiety of the merchants has turned it into a frantic, non-stop auction where memories, ideas, and fears are bought and sold.
    *   The party must trade a memory of their own to get information or barter a positive emotion to calm a panicked dream-figure.
**Escalation:** The "Bogeyman," a manifestation of the city's collective fears, appears in the marketplace, drawn to the party's foreign consciousness. It is an unstoppable hunter they must flee from, not fight.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Fortress of Forgotten Orders”
*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Puzzle
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The trail leads to the dream of the city's military barracks, a fortress where the soldiers' rigid discipline has created a predictable but dangerous labyrinth.
    *   The dream-guards here follow a strict, repeating patrol schedule. The party must observe their patterns and use stealth to proceed.
    *   They discover a memory-fragment that reveals the identity of the Nightmare Architect: the kingdom's young, grieving prince, thought to be in a coma.
**Escalation:** When the party finds the clue, they break the "script" of the dream. The dream-guards abandon their patrols and converge on the party's location with lethal, unthinking force.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Sandman** — *The Enigmatic Guide*
    *   **Role:** A native entity of the dream world who acts as a guide and quest-giver. It may be a re-flavored Djinni, Fey, or something else entirely.
    *   **Personality:** Whimsical, cryptic, and speaks in metaphors. It is bound by the dream's strange rules and can only help those who play along. It is amused by the solid, logical nature of the waking world.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Sandman is a part of the dreamscape's natural immune system. While it helps the party, its ultimate goal is to restore the dream to its natural, un-shaped state, which might not align with the party's goal of saving everyone.

2.  **The Bogeyman** — *The Hunter*
    *   **Role:** A manifestation of the city's collective fears—a hulking, shadowy beast that relentlessly hunts the party through the dream.
    *   **Personality:** A mindless, terrifying force of nature. It cannot be killed, only delayed or evaded. Its presence is heralded by a sudden drop in temperature and the sound of children's fearful whispers.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** It is drawn to fear. A character who can overcome their fear (passing a high-DC Wisdom save) becomes temporarily invisible to it.

3.  **Prince Alaric** — *The Nightmare Architect*
    *   **Role:** A ten-year-old boy with immense, untrained psychic powers. His grief over his mother's recent death triggered the Somnus Plague as his subconscious lashed out to silence a world he found too painful to be awake in.
    *   **Personality:** In the dream, he is a terrified, lonely child. His conscious mind is unaware of what he has done, while his subconscious manifests as powerful, defensive nightmares to protect him from further pain.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is just a child. While his power is immense, he can be reasoned with. Showing him genuine compassion and helping him process his grief is the only way to end the plague without shattering his mind.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Sleeping City:** The real-world city, now an eerie, silent testament to the plague.
2.  **The Labyrinth of Slumber:** The primary dungeon, a collective dreamscape including:
    *   **The Sea of Lost Memories:** A vast ocean where dreamers' forgotten memories wash up on the shore as smooth, glass-like pebbles.
    *   **The Library of Possibilities:** A library where every book is a story of a life a dreamer could have lived.
    *   **The Prince's Nightmare:** The heart of the dream, a twisted, gothic version of a royal nursery, filled with monstrous, living toys and shadowy figures.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a journey into a world of pure thought, where the greatest battles are fought against ideas, not monsters. The central conflict is a rescue mission that is also a therapy session. The players must act as psychologists and exorcists, navigating a surreal landscape to heal a broken mind and, in doing so, save their kingdom. It is a story about grief, empathy, and the power of the human subconscious.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Dream Logic**
*   The Labyrinth of Slumber does not obey the laws of physics. At the start of a new dream-region, the DM can introduce a new, temporary rule. *Examples: "Gravity is tied to your current emotion; sad characters are heavier." "You can only speak in questions." "Your physical size is determined by your confidence level."
*   Players can attempt to exert their own will on the dream. By using an action and succeeding on a high-DC Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check, a player can attempt to **Impose Belief** to create a simple, non-magical object, conjure a doorway on a wall, or convince a background dream-figure that they are supposed to be helping the party.

### 2. **Psychic Resonance**
*   Players cannot bring physical items into the dream, but they can carry their **Resonance**. Before a long rest, a player can choose to meditate on a specific person or object they have a strong connection to.
*   They can then bring a limited number of these Resonances into the dream. A Resonance allows for a one-time-use special ability.
*   *Examples: The Resonance of a guard's shield might allow a player to summon a spectral shield for one combat. The Resonance of a specific book might allow them to find a clue related to its contents. The Resonance of the sleeping King might help them pinpoint his location within the vast dreamscape.*
