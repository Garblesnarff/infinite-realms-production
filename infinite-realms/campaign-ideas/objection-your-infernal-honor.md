### Core Premise
The players are a newly formed legal team in the sprawling, infernal metropolis of Dis, a city where contracts are binding, souls are currency, and the law is a labyrinthine nightmare enforced by devils. They specialize in cases involving mortals who have inadvertently (or intentionally) entangled themselves in infernal contracts, demonic pacts, or bureaucratic nightmares. Their goal is to navigate the corrupt legal system, outwit infernal prosecutors, and save their clients' souls (or at least their assets) from eternal damnation, all while trying to make a name for themselves in a city where justice is a commodity.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Pro Bono & Purgatory (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players, fresh out of the Infernal Bar Association, take on their first few cases: a minor demon accused of contract fraud, a mortal who accidentally sold their soul for a sandwich, or a dispute over property rights in a newly annexed hellish district. They learn the intricacies of infernal law and the cutthroat nature of the legal profession in Dis.

**Act 2: The Scales of Sin (Sessions 4-8)**
- Their reputation grows, attracting more complex and dangerous cases. They might defend a powerful mortal noble accused of breaking a pact with an Archdevil, or represent a group of imps suing their tyrannical master for unfair labor practices. They uncover corruption within the infernal courts and make powerful enemies and uneasy allies.

**Act 3: The Grand Appeal (Sessions 9-12)**
- The players take on a landmark case that could shake the foundations of infernal law, perhaps challenging the legality of soul contracts themselves, or exposing a vast conspiracy within the highest echelons of the infernal judiciary. The final trial is a high-stakes battle of wits, rhetoric, and legal loopholes, with their own souls potentially on the line.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Opening Arguments**: The players establish their law firm in Dis. Their first client is a desperate imp accused of stealing a paperclip, which turns out to be a crucial component of a powerful Archdevil's infernal device. They must navigate their first infernal court case.
- **Session 2: The Sandwich Pact**: A commoner accidentally signs away their soul for a magically delicious sandwich. The players must find a loophole in the contract, perhaps by proving the sandwich was not of "infernal quality."
- **Session 3: Property Dispute in the Styx Suburbs**: A newly arrived mortal soul is trying to claim a plot of land in a contested district, but a powerful devil claims prior ownership. The players must investigate ancient infernal land deeds.
- **Session 4-5: The Archdevil's Due**: A wealthy mortal noble is accused of breaching a contract with a powerful Archdevil. The players must find a way to mitigate the damages, perhaps by offering a substitute soul or negotiating a new, less damning contract.
- **Session 6-7: Imp vs. Master**: The players represent a group of imps seeking better working conditions from their tyrannical demon master. This involves navigating infernal labor laws and facing a powerful, well-connected opponent.
- **Session 8: The Corrupt Judge**: The players uncover evidence that a judge in one of their cases is taking bribes. They must decide whether to expose the corruption, risking their own lives, or use it to their advantage.
- **Session 9-10: The Soul Contract Challenge**: The players take on a case that challenges the very nature of soul contracts, arguing for the free will of mortals against the infernal legal system. This is a multi-day trial with powerful opposing counsel.
- **Session 11-12: Verdict & Consequences**: The final arguments are made. The players face the consequences of their actions, whether they win or lose. The campaign ends with their firm either rising to prominence, being banished, or making a deal that changes them forever.

### Major NPCs

- **Prosecutor Malakor**: A cunning and ruthless devil lawyer. **Role**: Recurring Antagonist. **Personality**: Charismatic, manipulative, and utterly devoted to infernal law. He sees the players as naive upstarts. **Flaw/Secret**: He has a secret gambling addiction, which could be exploited.
- **Judge Abaddon**: A ancient, impartial (but easily bored) infernal judge. **Role**: Judge. **Personality**: Stoic, speaks in booming pronouncements, and values strict adherence to procedure above all else. **Flaw/Secret**: He has a soft spot for truly innovative legal arguments, even if they go against infernal tradition.
- **The Archivist, Xylos**: A neutral, ancient demon who maintains the vast Infernal Archives of contracts and legal precedents. **Role**: Informant / Gatekeeper. **Personality**: Monotone, obsessed with order and detail, speaks only in facts and citations. **Flaw/Secret**: He is secretly compiling a comprehensive list of every loophole ever discovered in infernal law, hoping to one day publish it.

### Key Locations

- **The Infernal Courthouse**: A towering, obsidian structure where trials are held, filled with screaming souls and bored devils.
- **The Archives of Damnation**: A vast, dusty library containing every contract ever signed, guarded by sentient scrolls and legal golems.
- **The Styx Bar & Grill**: A seedy establishment where lawyers, demons, and mortals alike drown their sorrows and exchange illicit information.
- **The Soul Market**: A bustling, terrifying marketplace where souls are traded, bought, and sold, often with complex legal clauses attached.

### Central Conflict
The struggle for justice and morality in a system designed to exploit and condemn. It's a battle of wits, legal acumen, and moral compromise against the ultimate bureaucracy.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Infernal Jurisprudence**: The legal system of Dis is complex and unforgiving. Players gain "Legal Precedent" points by successfully arguing cases, discovering loopholes, or citing obscure infernal laws. These points can be spent to gain advantages in future trials (e.g., introduce a new piece of evidence, challenge a prosecutor's argument, call a surprise witness). However, each case also has a "Moral Cost" tracker. Actions that compromise their ethics (e.g., knowingly defending a truly evil client, exploiting a technicality to condemn an innocent) increase their Moral Cost, which can attract the attention of higher devils, lead to public outcry among mortals, or even subtly corrupt their own alignment. This forces players to balance their legal victories with their conscience.
