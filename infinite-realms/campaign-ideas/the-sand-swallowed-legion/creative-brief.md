# Creative Brief: The Sand-Swallowed Legion

## Logline
Tasked with finding a lost artifact, players must track the real-life Lost Army of Cambyses, discovering the 50,000 soldiers weren't killed by a sandstorm but were imprisoned in a desert demiplane, where they now serve a powerful genie as an army of the undead.

## Genre
Desert Exploration, Rescue Mission, Undead Horror

## Key Features
*   **A Grand Historical Mystery:** The campaign is built around a famous, unsolved mystery from the ancient world, providing a strong narrative hook.
*   **A Unique, Hostile Environment:** Players must survive in a custom-built demiplane, a magical desert with its own rules, dangers, and ecology.
*   **Intelligent Undead Foes:** The antagonists are not mindless zombies but a disciplined army of undead soldiers, requiring tactical and strategic thinking from the players.
*   **Epic Bargains and Moral Choices:** The presence of an all-powerful Djinni allows for high-stakes social encounters and difficult moral choices that can change the fate of an entire legion.

## Target Audience
Fans of desert adventures, historical mysteries, and stories of epic survival. Players who enjoy tactical combat and facing off against intelligent, organized enemies. DMs who want to create a memorable, powerful NPC in the form of the Djinni.

## Voice

An ancient, male voice, dry and rasping, like sand blowing across forgotten ruins, with a deep, guttural Middle Eastern accent that echoes with the weight of millennia. The pacing is slow and deliberate, each word drawn out with immense, timeless patience, as if the speaker has witnessed the rise and fall of empires. The emotion is a blend of ancient power, cold amusement, and a profound, underlying weariness from eons of servitude. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, ambient static and the faint, distant sound of shifting sands and the mournful wail of desert winds. Role: The voice of the powerful Djinni, or a long-dead soldier recounting the legion's eternal, cursed fate.
