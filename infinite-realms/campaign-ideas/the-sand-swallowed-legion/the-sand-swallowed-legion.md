# The Sand-Swallowed Legion

## Real-World Basis: The Lost Army of Cambyses II
According to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, in 524 BC the Persian king Cambyses II sent an army of 50,000 soldiers from Thebes to attack the Oasis of Siwa. The army marched into the western desert of Egypt and was never seen again. Herodotus reports they were supposedly destroyed and buried by a cataclysmic sandstorm.

## D&D Twist
The army was not destroyed. The "sandstorm" was a manifestation of a powerful and cruel Djinni, who, offended by the army's intrusion, did not kill them. Instead, he transported the entire legion to a demiplane of his own creation—a vast, sun-scorched desert of black sand under a sky of burning brass. Here, time moves differently, and the soldiers have been trapped for centuries. Cursed with undeath, their bodies are now desiccated husks, their bronze armor fused with the black sand, and their minds are enslaved to the will of their genie master.

## Campaign Premise (Desert Exploration/Rescue Mission)
A high-ranking cleric of a sun god has a holy vision: a legendary artifact, the *Helm of the Unsetting Sun*, is needed to prevent a coming plague of darkness. The vision reveals that the helm was carried by the general of the lost legion. The players are hired and given a powerful magical compass to guide them. Their mission is to travel into a vast, magical desert, find the location where the army vanished, and recover the helm. They must discover the secret to entering the Djinni's demiplane, a feat that may require solving ancient riddles or performing a great service for a desert entity. Once inside, they must navigate the treacherous demiplane, contend with its strange physics and monstrous inhabitants, and finally confront the Sand-Swallowed Legion and its undead general to claim the artifact. They might try to break the curse, fight the legion, or even bargain with the ancient Djinni for the helm.

## Key Elements
*   **A Hostile Demiplane:** The Djinni's prison is a character in itself. The black sands might drain life, mirages can become temporarily real and hostile, and the brass sun inflicts magical exhaustion. There is no natural water, and survival is a constant challenge.
*   **An Army of the Undead:** The legion is not a mindless horde. They retain their military discipline and tactics, making them a formidable and intelligent foe. Their general is a powerful Mummy Lord, a brilliant strategist who has had centuries to perfect his tactics in this sand-filled hell.
*   **The Djinni's Game:** The Djinni who controls the plane is not a simple boss monster. He is an ancient, powerful being, bored and cruel. He may see the players as new toys, forcing them into gladiatorial games against his legionaries or setting them impossible tasks for his own amusement. Defeating him might not be possible; outsmarting him may be the only way.
*   **Moral Ambiguity:** The soldiers of the legion are both monsters and victims. The players might find a way to break their curse, potentially gaining 50,000 allies, but doing so could displease the Djinni and risk being trapped themselves. Is retrieving the artifact worth leaving the legion to its fate?

## Tone
*Lawrence of Arabia* meets *The Mummy* (1999), with the planar-hopping elements of *Chronomancer*. A sweeping desert adventure of exploration, survival, and a confrontation with ancient history.
