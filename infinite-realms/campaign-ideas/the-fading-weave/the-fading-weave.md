## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the death of magic, the adaptation to loss, and the moral complexity of wielding dangerous power. The central conflict revolves around the Great Silence and the entity responsible for it. The players must navigate increasingly dangerous magical phenomena while deciding whether to restore the Weave at any cost or accept a world without magic.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Weave Strain System**
*   Players track "Weave Strain" that accumulates each time they use magic.
*   High strain causes magical backlash, from minor inconveniences to dangerous magical storms.
*   Players must balance the benefits of magic against the risk of causing greater catastrophe.

### 2. **The Magic Resource Web**
*   Players build a network of magical resources, from minor artifacts to major Weave nexuses.
*   The network provides magical power but requires protection and maintenance.
*   Network strength affects available spells, magical research, and the campaign's overall magical landscape.

### 3. **The Adaptation Track**
*   Players track their adaptation to the post-Silence world, gaining mundane skills to compensate for lost magic.
*   High adaptation provides powerful non-magical abilities but may reduce magical affinity.
*   The system creates meaningful choices between embracing magic's return or adapting to its absence.
