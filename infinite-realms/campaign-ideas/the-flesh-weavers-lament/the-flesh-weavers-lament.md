**Campaign Type / Genre:** Grimdark Body Horror / Investigation / Philosophical Horror
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 10-12 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **11-12**
**Tone (keywords):** grotesque, grim, desperate, horrific, tense
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
A horrific plague called the "Crimson Weave" is spreading across the land, merging living creatures—people, animals, and plants—into grotesque, multi-souled abominations known as "Amalgams." The players are "Stitch-Hunters," specialists sanctioned by a desperate state to hunt these monstrosities and uncover the plague's source. As they follow the trail of corrupted flesh, they discover the plague is not mindless but guided by a single, malevolent will. The players must confront not only the physical horror of the Amalgams but the philosophical terror of a being who seeks to end individual suffering by merging all life into a single, unified consciousness.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the horror of losing bodily autonomy, the philosophy of unity versus individuality, and the desperation of preventing world-ending catastrophe. The central conflict revolves around the Crimson Weave and the Flesh-Weaver's plan to merge all life. The players must navigate increasingly intelligent Amalgams while grappling with their own growing corruption. The campaign forces difficult questions: Is individuality worth the suffering it causes? Can some forms of unity be beautiful? And what happens when the boundary between self and other dissolves?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Crimson Weave Corruption System**
*   Players track "Corruption Points" that accumulate through exposure to the plague.
*   Corruption Points provide twisted benefits (enhanced abilities, resistance to damage) but also drawbacks (mutations, madness, social penalties).
*   Players can spend Corruption Points for temporary power surges or save them for crucial moments.

### 2. **Amalgam Core-Souls System**
*   Major Amalgams are complex bosses composed of multiple creatures with consciousness stored in "Core Souls."
*   The Amalgam is immune to most damage until a Core Soul is exposed through called shots or puzzle-solving.
*   Destroying a Core Soul removes attacks, disables regeneration, or creates new weaknesses.

### 3. **The Psychic Chorus**
*   Players can attempt to communicate with the minds trapped within Amalgams.
*   Successful communication provides clues but risks psychic backlash or corruption.
*   The chorus evolves based on player actions, potentially becoming allies or antagonists.
