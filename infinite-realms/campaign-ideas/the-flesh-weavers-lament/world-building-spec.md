**The Flesh-Weaver's Lament: Symphony of Flesh**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** A horrific plague called the "Crimson Weave" is spreading across the land, merging living creatures—people, animals, and plants—into grotesque, multi-souled abominations known as "Amalgams." The players are "Stitch-Hunters," specialists sanctioned by a desperate state to hunt these monstrosities and uncover the plague's source. As they follow the trail of corrupted flesh, they discover the plague is not mindless but guided by a single, malevolent will. The players must confront not only the physical horror of the Amalgams but the philosophical terror of a being who seeks to end individual suffering by merging all life into a single, unified consciousness.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

    *   Write the history of the Flesh-Weaver's transformation from cleric to harbinger of the Crimson Weave.
    *   Describe the nature of the Crimson Weave itself - is it a conscious entity, a magical disease, or something more primordial?
    *   Explain how the Crimson Weave has evolved from isolated incidents to a world-threatening catastrophe.
    *   Detail the various attempts by kingdoms and organizations to contain or cure the Crimson Weave and their ultimate failures.
    *   Write about the "Corrupted" - individuals who have survived partial corruption and the strange abilities and madness that come with it.
