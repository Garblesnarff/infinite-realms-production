## What “Hard” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat is brutal and unforgiving. Enemies are savage and desperate, and the party will often be outnumbered and outgunned.
*   **Survival:** The party must constantly manage their resources, especially water. Dehydration, starvation, and exhaustion are as dangerous as any monster.
*   **Consequences:** Death is a very real possibility. The world is a dangerous place, and a single mistake can lead to a gruesome end. The party will have to make hard choices to survive, and not all of them will be heroic.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Water as a Resource**

*   Water is the most important resource in the campaign. The party must carefully track their water supplies, and they will need to find new sources of water to survive.
*   **Dehydration:** A character who goes without water for too long will begin to suffer from dehydration, which will cause exhaustion and eventually death.

### 2. **Scavenging and Crafting**

*   The party will need to scavenge for supplies in the ruins of the old world. They can find food, water, weapons, and valuable technology.
*   **Crafting:** The party can use the materials they find to craft and repair their own equipment.

### 3. **Mutations**

*   The magical cataclysm that destroyed the world has left its mark on the creatures that survived. Many of the monsters the party will face will have strange and terrifying mutations.
*   **Player Mutations:** The party may also be exposed to the lingering magical radiation of the cataclysm, which could cause them to develop their own mutations, for better or for worse.
