### 8-10 Session Breakdown

This campaign is designed to be played over 8 to 10 sessions, with each session building upon the last and escalating the stakes.

**Session 1: The Frost-Kissed Festival**
The campaign begins in the quaint village of Oakhaven during the annual Winter Solstice festival. The celebration is cut short by an unnatural, biting cold and the appearance of ice-infused creatures. The players must protect the villagers and, in the aftermath, are sought out by the village elder, who reveals an ancient prophecy that foretells their destiny.

**Session 2: The Withering Woods**
To understand the growing threat, the heroes are sent to find a mysterious ranger named Elara in the nearby Whisperwood. The once-lush forest is now a frozen, haunted landscape. Elara will test the party's skills before agreeing to guide them on their perilous journey.

**Session 3: The Perilous Pass**
The party's first major journey takes them through a treacherous mountain pass, where they will face not only Volkov's forces but also the increasing environmental dangers of the eternal winter. They may also have a chance encounter with Barnaby Stoutale, a comically resilient innkeeper fleeing with his precious cargo of ale.

**Session 4: The Citadel of Fallen Knights**
The heroes arrive at Skyreach Keep, a mountain fortress and home to the once-renowned Griffon Knights. They must persuade the bitter and treacherous Lord Valerius to join their cause. This may involve undertaking a dangerous side quest to prove their worth.

**Session 5: The Sunken City of the Dwarves**
Elara guides the party to the long-lost underground dwarven city of Khazad-Thul in search of an ancient forge capable of creating weapons to combat Volkov's dark magic. The city is a maze of riddles, traps, and the lingering spirits of its former inhabitants.

**Session 6: The Dragon's Counsel**
The quest for knowledge leads the party to the lair of Ignis, an ancient gold dragon who was once a guardian of the Crown of Aethermoor. He will only offer his aid if the party can prove their worthiness and pure intentions.

**Session 7: The Fallen Champion**
As the heroes grow in power, Volkov sends his most formidable servant to stop them: Kaelen, the Frost-Bitten, a once-heroic figure now corrupted by dark magic. This encounter will be a significant test of the party's strength and resolve.

**Session 8: The Tower of Endless Frost**
The party must assault Volkov's fortress, a towering spire of black ice that pierces the perpetually stormy sky. They will face magical defenses, powerful minions, and the full force of the eternal winter.

**Session 9: The Heart of Winter**
The final confrontation with Volkov takes place at the peak of his tower, on a battlefield of swirling snow and ice. The party must defeat the sorcerer and reclaim the Crown of Aethermoor to end the eternal winter.

**Session 10: The Thawing**
With the crown recovered, the unnatural winter begins to recede. The heroes are celebrated throughout the realm and must decide the fate of the powerful artifact. Lingering threats and the political fallout of their actions can be explored.
