# The Dungeon Keepers' Guild

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Reverse Dungeon Crawl / Dark Comedy / Tactical Defense
- **Estimated Length**: 8-10 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-5 (as monsters/minions)
- **Tone**: Humorous, Strategic, Chaotic, Underdog

### Core Premise
The players are not heroes; they are the monsters. Specifically, they are a newly formed, ragtag group of goblins, kobolds, or other low-level monstrous humanoids, recently hired by the notoriously incompetent (and perpetually underfunded) Dungeon Keepers' Guild. Their job? To maintain a dilapidated dungeon, set traps, manage unruly monster populations, and, most importantly, defend it from waves of increasingly annoying and powerful adventurers. The campaign is a series of defensive encounters, resource management, and dark comedy as the players try to keep their dungeon from being "cleared."

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Minion Management (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players are assigned their first dungeon, a crumbling ruin with a few rusty traps and a handful of disgruntled goblins. They must learn the ropes of dungeon keeping, dealing with internal squabbles, repairing defenses, and fending off their first wave of low-level adventurers.

**Act 2: The Adventurer Menace (Sessions 4-7)**
- The adventurers grow stronger and more organized, launching more sophisticated assaults. The players must get creative with their traps, recruit new (and often unreliable) monsters, and manage their limited resources to keep the dungeon operational. They might even have to venture out to sabotage adventurer camps or steal supplies.

**Act 3: The Grand Delve (Sessions 8-10)**
- A legendary hero or a powerful adventuring party sets their sights on the players' dungeon. This is the ultimate test of their dungeon-keeping skills. The players must pull out all the stops, utilizing every trap, monster, and dirty trick they've learned to defend their home and prove their worth to the Guild, or face utter destruction.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Welcome to the Pit**: The players are introduced to their new (and terrible) dungeon. Their first task is to clean up a goblin latrine and repair a broken pit trap. They receive a warning about an approaching band of novice adventurers.
- **Session 2: The First Wave**: The players must defend against a group of level 1 adventurers. Focus on trap placement, monster tactics, and learning the dungeon's layout. They might capture one for interrogation.
- **Session 3: Internal Affairs**: A group of their own goblins goes on strike, demanding better rations. The players must negotiate, intimidate, or trick them back into service. They also receive their first budget report from the Guild, which is abysmal.
- **Session 4-5: The Rogue's Gambit**: A more cunning group of adventurers attempts to bypass their defenses. The players must adapt, perhaps setting up a false treasure room or a collapsing ceiling trap.
- **Session 6-7: Recruitment Drive**: The dungeon is running low on monsters. The players must venture into the nearby wilderness to recruit new minions (e.g., a grumpy Ogre, a family of giant spiders, a mischievous mimic) or steal eggs from a dragon wyrmling.
- **Session 8: The Guild Inspection**: A representative from the Dungeon Keepers' Guild arrives for an inspection. The players must make their dungeon look presentable and efficient, despite its flaws, to avoid being fired.
- **Session 9-10: The Hero's Challenge**: A powerful hero (or party) arrives, determined to clear the dungeon. This is the final, multi-stage defense. The players must use all their resources, cunning, and teamwork to repel the threat. The campaign ends with either the hero's defeat and the dungeon's preservation, or its inevitable fall.

### Major NPCs

- **Grizelda, the Guild Overseer**: A perpetually exasperated hobgoblin who manages the Dungeon Keepers' Guild. **Role**: Boss / Taskmaster. **Personality**: Jaded, sarcastic, and utterly fed up with incompetent minions and demanding adventurers. **Flaw/Secret**: She secretly dreams of retiring to a quiet farm, but her contract with the Guild is for life.
- **Snivvel, the Head Goblin**: The leader of the existing goblin population in the dungeon. **Role**: Subordinate / Comic Relief. **Personality**: Cowardly, lazy, and prone to complaining, but surprisingly loyal when properly motivated (or threatened). **Flaw/Secret**: He has a secret stash of shiny rocks that he believes will one day make him rich.
- **Sir Reginald the Righteous**: A recurring, increasingly frustrated adventurer. **Role**: Recurring Antagonist. **Personality**: Arrogant, self-righteous, and utterly convinced of his own heroism. **Flaw/Secret**: He is deeply in debt and needs the dungeon's treasure to pay off his loans, making him desperate and predictable.

### Key Locations

- **The Crumbling Entrance**: The main entry point to the dungeon, constantly in need of repair.
- **The Trap Workshop**: Where the players can design, build, and repair their various contraptions.
- **The Monster Barracks**: A chaotic, smelly area where the dungeon's inhabitants live, constantly bickering.
- **The Treasure Vault (Empty)**: A grand chamber meant to hold treasure, currently mostly empty, serving as a constant reminder of their financial woes.

### Central Conflict
The struggle of the underdog to protect their home and livelihood against overwhelming odds. It's a battle of wits and dirty tricks against the traditional forces of good.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Dungeon Resource Management**: Players have a limited budget (gold, raw materials, monster morale) to maintain and upgrade their dungeon. They can spend resources on new traps, repairing existing ones, recruiting new monsters, or improving monster living conditions (which affects morale and effectiveness). Each successful defense against adventurers yields a small reward, but also damages the dungeon, requiring repairs. This creates a constant push-and-pull between offense and defense, forcing strategic decisions about where to allocate their meager resources. Players might also have to deal with monster "payroll" and "HR" issues, like a goblin demanding better food or a kobold complaining about a draft.
