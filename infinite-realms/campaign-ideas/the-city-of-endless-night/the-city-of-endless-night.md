The victims are all high-ranking members of the city's magical elite, and their deaths threaten to ignite a war between the city's powerful factions. The party must navigate a world of femme fatales, corrupt politicians, and ancient curses to find the killer before the city drowns in its own darkness.

## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat will be fast, brutal, and often unexpected. The party will face off against shadowy assassins, magical constructs, and things that go bump in the night. However, the real challenges are the investigation and the social encounters.
*   **Investigation:** The campaign is a classic noir mystery. The party will need to gather clues, interrogate suspects, and connect the dots to solve the case. This will require a sharp eye for detail, a skeptical mind, and a willingness to bend the rules.
*   **Consequences:** The city of Gloomhaven is a powder keg, and the party is lighting matches. Their actions can have serious and far-reaching consequences, and a single mistake could plunge the city into chaos.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A three-act arc that takes the party from a single murder to a city-wide conspiracy.

*   **Act I — The First Body (Sessions 1–2):** The party is called in to investigate the murder of a prominent wizard. They soon discover that this is not a simple crime of passion, but the work of a cunning and ruthless killer.
*   **Act II — The Long Goodbye (Sessions 3–5):** The body count rises, and the party finds themselves drawn deeper into the city's magical underworld. They uncover a conspiracy that involves a powerful and ancient curse, a secret society, and a struggle for control of the city's magical resources.
*   **Act III — The Big Sleep (Sessions 6–8):** The party has identified the killer, but the truth is more complicated and dangerous than they ever imagined. They must confront the killer and the conspiracy behind them in a final, desperate showdown.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a classic noir mystery, a search for truth in a city that is built on lies. It is a story about the corrupting influence of power, the darkness that lurks in the hearts of men, and the struggle to find a glimmer of light in a world of endless night. The party must not only solve a series of murders, but also confront the darkness within themselves.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Clue System**

*   The investigation is the heart of the campaign, and the party will need to gather clues to solve the case. Clues can be physical objects, pieces of information, or the testimony of witnesses. The DM should create a web of clues that the party can follow to the truth.

### 2. **Flashbacks**

*   At key moments in the investigation, a player can use a flashback to reveal that their character had a previous encounter with a suspect or a location that is relevant to the case. This allows the players to retroactively add to the story and to feel like they are a part of the city's history.

### 3. **The Corruption of Magic**

*   In Gloomhaven, magic is a powerful but dangerous force. Using powerful magic can attract the attention of the city's dark entities, and it can also corrupt the user, twisting their mind and body. The DM can represent this with a Corruption score, similar to the Sanity score in a horror campaign.
