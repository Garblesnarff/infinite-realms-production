# Creative Brief: The City of Endless Night

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Neo-Noir Graphic Novel (Sin City-inspired)

Inspired by the iconic, high-contrast aesthetic of Frank Miller's *Sin City*, this style aims to capture the cynical, shadowy, and fatalistic tone of Gloomhaven. It blends the classic elements of film noir with a stylized, gritty realism, using selective color to highlight the magical and mysterious elements within the perpetual darkness.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Black and White:** The default should be monochrome, with deep blacks and stark whites. Describe the interplay of light and shadow as the primary visual element.
*   **Strategic Color:** When color is used, it should be a deliberate choice to draw attention to a specific detail, character, or magical effect. It should be a single, vibrant hue against the monochrome.
*   **Atmospheric Elements:** Rain, smoke, and fog are crucial for setting the mood and enhancing the noir aesthetic.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Noir, shadowy, rain-soaked, cynical, fatalistic, gritty, mysterious, high-contrast, atmospheric.
*   **Feeling:** A world where morality is gray, and danger lurks in every shadow. A sense of impending doom, with brief flashes of beauty or hope. The city itself is a character, oppressive and unforgiving.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Strong, bold lines define characters and objects, reminiscent of comic book ink work. Forms are realistic but often exaggerated for dramatic effect, especially in character expressions and architectural details.
*   **Textures:** Gritty, rough textures for concrete, brick, and worn clothing. Smooth, reflective surfaces for wet streets and polished interiors.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly stylized graphic novel illustration in the style of Sin City. The focus is on the stark black and white contrast, with bold, inky lines defining the rain-slicked alleyway."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Predominantly black and white. Deep, inky blacks for shadows and silhouettes, stark whites for highlights and light sources. 
*   **Accent Colors:** When color is introduced, it should be a single, striking hue (e.g., emerald green, blood red, electric blue, golden yellow) used for specific elements like eyes, a piece of jewelry, a magical glow, or a character's lips. This color should pop dramatically against the monochrome background.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a high-contrast black and white scene, with the only color being the vibrant emerald green of a femme fatale's eyes, glowing ominously in the darkness."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are often angular, with strong jawlines and expressive, often weary, faces. Clothing is classic noir: trench coats, fedoras, sharp suits, elegant dresses. 
*   **Silhouettes:** Characters are frequently depicted in silhouette against a light source, emphasizing their mysterious nature.
*   **Expression:** Expressions are often subtle, conveying cynicism, suspicion, or hidden pain. When emotions are strong, they are exaggerated for dramatic effect.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A hard-boiled detective in a fedora and trench coat, his face partially obscured by the shadow of his hat. His eyes, the only color in the monochrome scene, glow with a faint, arcane blue."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Towering Art Deco skyscrapers loom over narrow, perpetually wet streets. Architecture is grand but often decaying, reflecting the city's hidden corruption.
*   **Atmosphere:** Constant rain, fog, and steam. Neon signs reflect on wet surfaces, creating distorted, glowing streaks of light.
*   **Details:** Grimy fire escapes, overflowing gutters, flickering streetlights, and the occasional arcane symbol subtly integrated into the urban landscape.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A rain-slicked street in Gloomhaven at night. Towering Art Deco skyscrapers disappear into the perpetual gloom, their windows reflecting distorted neon signs. A single, flickering streetlight casts long, sharp shadows."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Extreme chiaroscuro. Light sources are often harsh and directional (streetlights, car headlights, neon signs, a single desk lamp), creating stark contrasts and deep, impenetrable shadows.
*   **Shadows:** Shadows are absolute black and are used as compositional elements, hiding parts of characters or environments, and creating a sense of menace and mystery.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to define the mood, highlight key details, and create a sense of tension and unease.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a single, harsh streetlight, casting long, sharp shadows that stretch across the wet pavement. The scene is dominated by deep blacks and stark whites."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic and often uses Dutch angles (tilted horizons) to create a sense of unease. Compositions are often tight and claustrophobic, even in wide shots, emphasizing the oppressive nature of the city.
*   **Techniques:** Use strong diagonals, leading lines (e.g., rain streaks, architectural elements), and framing (e.g., through a window, under an archway). Silhouettes are frequently used to create iconic, mysterious imagery.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Dutch angle shot of a character standing in a rain-soaked alley, their silhouette stark against the glowing, wet pavement. The composition uses strong diagonal lines to create a sense of unease."

## Voice

A deep, gravelly male voice, like the worn-out treads of a detective's shoes on a rain-slicked street. His standard American accent is tinged with the cynical wisdom of a thousand unsolved cases, with a slow, deliberate pacing that allows the shadows to deepen and the mysteries to unfold. The emotion is a pervasive mystery, a world-weary fatalism that hints at secrets too dark to speak aloud. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, almost imperceptible, layer of static and the distant, mournful wail of a police siren. Role: The hardboiled detective narrating his own descent into the grimy underbelly of Gloomhaven.
