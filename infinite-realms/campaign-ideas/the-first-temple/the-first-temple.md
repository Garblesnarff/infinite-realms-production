# The First Temple

## Real-World Basis: Göbekli Tepe
An archaeological site in Turkey containing a massive temple complex dated to 9,500 BC. It was built by a society that was believed to be primitive hunter-gatherers, yet it predates Stonehenge by 6,000 years and shows immense architectural and social organization. After a period of use, its builders deliberately and completely buried it, hiding it for millennia.

## D&D Twist
The temple wasn't built by humans. It was constructed by a coalition of the world's first sentient races (perhaps early Elves, Dwarves, or even Aboleths) during the Dawn War. It is not a place of worship, but a prison. The entire complex is a massive, three-dimensional arcane ward, designed to hold a single, world-destroying primordial entity of chaos and destruction. The reason it was buried was to complete the binding and erase its memory from the world.

## Campaign Premise (Ancient Mystery/Dungeon Crawl)
A mining guild of dwarves, in their endless digging for riches, accidentally breaches the outermost layer of the buried First Temple. Seeing only a treasure-trove of a lost civilization, they begin a full-scale excavation. As they dig deeper, the primordial's influence begins to leak out. The land for miles around suffers earthquakes, wildlife becomes twisted and aggressive, and local people are plagued by nightmares and madness. The players are hired to investigate the "haunted" dig site. They soon discover the temple's true purpose and realize that the excavation is catastrophically weakening the ancient prison. They must convince the greedy dwarves to stop, then descend into the newly-opened levels of the temple, battling the ancient, automated guardians and maddened elemental spirits within. Their goal is to reach the central chamber and find a way to reactivate and reinforce the wards before the primordial fully awakens and finishes the war it lost at the dawn of time.

## Key Elements
*   **A Dungeon with a Purpose:** The First Temple is not a random collection of rooms and monsters. Every chamber, trap, and guardian was designed as part of a massive arcane machine. Players can learn to understand the dungeon's logic to overcome its challenges.
*   **The Ticking Clock:** The primordial's influence grows stronger as the campaign progresses. The players will see the effects on the outside world getting worse each time they emerge from the temple, creating a powerful sense of urgency.
*   **Moral Dilemma:** The dwarves are not evil; they are just greedy and ignorant of the danger they have unleashed. The players must find a way to deal with them, either through persuasion, intimidation, or force, adding a social and political layer to the adventure.
*   **Echoes of the Past:** As they explore, the players can uncover echoes and memories of the Dawn War, learning forgotten secrets about the gods, the primordials, and the very creation of the world.

## Tone
*The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (specifically the Moria sequence) meets *The Mummy* (1999). A classic dungeon crawl filled with ancient mystery, a sense of impending doom, and the weight of forgotten history.
