# Creative Brief: The First Temple

## Logline
Inspired by the real-life discovery of Göbekli Tepe, the world's oldest temple, players discover that a fantasy version of the site is not a temple, but an ancient prison for a world-destroying primordial. They must delve into its depths to reactivate its failing wards before a greedy mining guild accidentally sets the prisoner free.

## Genre
Ancient Mystery, Dungeon Crawl, Cosmic Horror

## Key Features

*   **Deep Lore:** The adventure is steeped in the forgotten history of the D&D multiverse, allowing players to uncover secrets of the Dawn War and the creation of the world.
*   **Classic D&D Action:** A perfect setup for a classic dungeon crawl, featuring traps, puzzles, ancient guardians, and a titanic final boss.

## Target Audience
Fans of classic, high-stakes dungeon crawls like *Tomb of Horrors* or *The Temple of Elemental Evil*. Players who love deep lore, ancient mysteries, and the feeling of uncovering a world-shattering secret.

## Voice

A deep, ancient, and gender-neutral voice, like the grinding of colossal stone blocks or the slow, inexorable shift of tectonic plates. The timbre is resonant and carries a subtle, guttural hum, as if emanating from the very core of the earth. The pacing is slow and deliberate, each word heavy with the weight of eons, building a profound sense of cosmic dread. The emotion is a blend of detached, primordial power and a chilling, foreboding indifference to the fate of mortals. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a pervasive, low-frequency rumble and a subtle, echoing resonance that suggests vast, subterranean chambers and the immense pressure of a world-prison. Role: The voice of the primordial entity trapped within the temple, or the disembodied voice of the temple's ancient, failing wards.
