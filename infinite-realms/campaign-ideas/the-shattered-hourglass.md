# The Shattered Hourglass

*A Surreal Fantasy / Mystery campaign — Full Campaign (12–14 sessions) — Hard difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Shattered Hourglass
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Surreal Fantasy (dreamlike, meta-narrative, cosmic)
**Estimated Length:** Full Campaign — 12–14 sessions (3 arcs)
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → End **12–13**
**Tone (keywords):** mysterious, disorienting, tragic, awe-inspiring, strange beauty
**Core Premise:**
Time itself has fractured — every person, city, and creature now exists in multiple contradictory versions, and only the PCs remember that reality *used to be one thing*. They must navigate a world where yesterday doesn’t match today, where rulers wake to find themselves beggars, and where monsters change species mid-battle. Their quest is to discover who (or what) shattered the Hourglass of Aeons — but every truth they uncover might rewrite the party itself.

---

## What “Hard” Difficulty Means Here

* **Encounters:** Frequent hard encounters (multiple CR-appropriate monsters, legendary actions, lair effects).
* **Challenges:** Puzzles that change mid-solution, shifting rules (time rewinds, initiative order mutates).
* **Survival:** Resource drain — long rests may “rewind” players to earlier states unless protected.

---

## Story Arc (Full Campaign — 3 Acts, 12–14 Sessions)

**Act I — Splintered Days (Sessions 1–4):** The PCs realize reality doesn’t stay fixed; rumors, people, and even themselves shift between sessions. They begin piecing together fragments of the Hourglass.

**Act II — Broken Chrones (Sessions 5–9):** Exploration of bizarre locations where time loops, forks, or collapses. They encounter “Chrones” — beings made of different ages of themselves — and must decide which versions to trust.

**Act III — The Grain of Never (Sessions 10–14):** The Hourglass’s last grain of sand still falls — and when it lands, one version of reality will “win.” The PCs face the Paradox Entity that shattered the Hourglass and decide which timeline to preserve… or whether to let the multitudes remain.

## Major NPCs (5–8)

1. **The Beggar-Queen Alara** — ruler who shifts identity daily; wants stability.
2. **Ephram the Chronomancer** — time-worn wizard; memory full of holes; guides PCs but may betray them if his “favorite version” is threatened.
3. **The First Crone** — three ages at once; tragic seer of the Hourglass.
4. **Paradox Entity (“The Keeper of What Was”)** — final boss; claims it shattered the Hourglass to “free” existence from fate.
5. **Mirith the Doppelganger Prophet** — cult leader convinced only one “true” version should survive.
6. **The Bride & Groom (Jenya and Solen)** — locked in eternal wedding that never concludes.
7. **Future-PC (mirror self)** — alternate version of one of the players, possibly hostile.

---

## Key Locations

1. **The City of Forking Paths** — simultaneously utopia, tyranny, ruin.
2. **The Library of Never-Was** — infinite shifting archive.
3. **Chronomachina** — colossal machine grinding centuries.
4. **The Hourglass Shardlands** — desert full of broken sand-glass towers.
5. **The Wedding Hall** — metaphysical space where vows reshape reality.

---

## Central Conflict

**The Shattered Hourglass broke reality into splinters.** PCs must decide which version of existence survives — or embrace chaos and let all timelines fight for dominance.

---

## Side Quests (3–5)

1. **The Child Who Never Grew:** A 10-year-old who has lived for centuries, repeating the same birthday. PCs can free him by “choosing” his future.
2. **The Man of Many Deaths:** NPC who remembers dying a dozen times. Can he be convinced to share his “extra lives”?
3. **The Festival of Unbirth:** Town celebrates the day none of them were born. PCs can investigate why.
4. **The Mirror Duel:** Each PC faces their strongest alternate self in a dream-arena. Winner overwrites the other.
5. **The Clockmaker’s Debt:** A craftsman can fix the Hourglass shard, but he demands one of the PCs trade away *their happiest memory.*

---

## Unique Mechanics

1. **Timeline Shifts:** Once per session, DM declares a “Shift” — environment, NPC identities, and even PCs’ minor details change (accent, scars, spells known).
2. **Self-Divergence:** Each player designs at least 1 alternate version of their PC (different subclass/background). These alternates appear as allies/enemies.
3. **Paradox Points:** Each paradox (contradiction embraced) gives a PC a reroll — but stack 3, and reality punishes you (random wild magic surge).
4. **Boss Mechanic — Paradox Entity:** Each round, it shifts stat blocks (start as Adult Red Dragon, then swap to Archmage, then Solar, etc.). Keeps 50% HP between forms.

---

## Multiple Endings

1. **One Timeline Survives:** PCs choose which version of the world becomes real. Costs other versions — including possibly alternate selves.
2. **All Splinters Remain:** Chaos reigns; reality forever unstable, but infinite possibility.
3. **New Reality Forged:** PCs sacrifice themselves to weave a new timeline. Players co-create world epilogue.
4. **The Paradox Wins:** PCs fail — Keeper of What Was reigns, time loops endlessly. Campaign ends with Session 1 repeating.

## Thumbnail Ideas (Visuals)

1. **“City of Forking Paths”** — One skyline shown in three layers: golden utopia, burning ruins, gray dictatorship. PCs walking between them.
2. **“The Paradox Entity”** — A being made of fractured glass shards, each shard reflecting a different monster/ally.
3. **“The Final Grain”** — Giant hourglass suspended in void; last grain glowing like a star, falling into abyss.
