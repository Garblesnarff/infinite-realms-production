# The Library of Lost Tomorrows

*A Metafantasy / Weird Fantasy campaign — Full Campaign (12–14 sessions) — Medium–Hard*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Library of Lost Tomorrows
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Metafantasy — the world as a literary artifact; time, memory, and fate are written things.
**Estimated Length:** Full Campaign — 12–14 sessions (3–5 hours each)
**Player Level Range:** Start **1** → Finish **12–13** (scales from small mysteries to cosmic edits)
**Tone (keywords):** lyrical, uncanny, high-stakes wonder, bittersweet, cerebral danger
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
A colossal, impossible Library holds every possible future and every abandoned “what-if.” Someone — or something — is stealing entire chapters. When characters open their own lost pages and discover they never existed in certain timelines, reality begins to thin: people vanish, histories overlap, and entire towns become footnotes. The party must descend into archives of memory, outwit an editor-god who believes perfect endings are merciful, and decide which futures are worth keeping — even if that means burning others.

---

## What “Medium–Hard” Means Here

* **Combat:** Fewer fights than a standard dungeon crawl but higher-stakes and often weird (reality-warping enemies, fights across shifting scenes). Expect 1–2 meaningful combats per session.
* **Challenges:** Heavy mix of social inference, puzzle-like “editing” tasks, and time/logic problems. Some encounters require out-of-the-box solutions (rewording a clause, assembling a phrase, trading memories).
* **Consequences:** Failures can remove NPCs, erase side-quests, or change previously resolved outcomes — not instant TPK but costly to story and resources.

## Story Arc (Three Acts — 12–14 sessions)

### Act I — Pages Misplaced (Sessions 1–4)

Introduce the Library, its rules, and the first fractures: missing people, repeating days, a mayor who remembers two lives. The party follows small threads: a child who can speak in future-tense, a book that hums with a character name that wasn't born.

### Act II — The Stacks Unspooled (Sessions 5–9)

Deeper exploration into the Library’s levels: Marginalia Market, Palimpsest Sea, the Forbidden Annex. The party uncovers the Redactor — a cosmic editor pruning possibility — and the Archive’s bureaucracy (librarians, binders, errant phrases made flesh). Moral choices force the party to retire or save entire storylines.

### Act III — The Final Draft (Sessions 10–14)

Climax at the Null Archive where stolen endings are stripped. The party must either reclaim the stolen chapters (risking paradox), broker terms with the Redactor, or rewrite an ending that permanently reshapes the world. Multiple endings based on whether they preserve plurality, accept a single “perfect” course, or sabotage the Library entirely.

## Session-by-Session Outline

1. **“Shelf Test”** — Focus: Introduction / Social / Investigation

   * Hook: A traveling storyteller’s tale stops mid-sentence and the crowd dissolves from memory.
   * Key events: Meet a Binder (small librarian), explore a town missing its festivals, acquire the first “lost page” (a physical scrap that hums).

2. **“Dust & Marginalia”** — Focus: Exploration / Puzzle

   * Key events: Visit a bazaar where scribes trade memories; bargain for a marginal note that points to the Library’s nearest gate.

3. **“The Gatekeeper’s Index”** — Focus: Social / Skill Challenge

   * Key events: Convince a bureaucratic Indexer to grant passage (or sneak in); learn the Library’s rule: read a future, risk its erosion.

4. **“The Shannon Room”** — Focus: Combat / Weird hazard

   * Key events: Navigate stacks where narrative rules flicker (gravity inverts when a sentence flips), defeat grammar-spirits (Ink Wraiths), rescue a librarian-ally.

5. **“Palimpsest Sea”** — Focus: Exploration / Roleplay

   * Key events: Sail a sea of erased words; face memories-turned-sirens; retrieve a “lost tomorrow” for a grieving NPC (moral cost).

6. **“The Bromide Trials”** — Focus: Puzzle / Moral test

   * Key events: A trial judged by personified tropes (The Cliché, The Tragic Arc); win or lose affects later narrative favor.

7. **“In the Margins of War”** — Focus: Investigation / Combat

   * Key events: Discover a militarized faction harvesting endings for weapons; foil a raid or negotiate.

8. **“The Redactor’s Echo”** — Focus: Revelation / Social showdown

   * Key events: First direct contact with the Redactor’s lieutenant, a perfect protagonist who believes in mercy-through-erasure.

9. **“The False Epilogues”** — Focus: Dungeon (library-floor) / High stakes

   * Key events: Recover several stolen endings from the Forbidden Annex; paradox fractures: one PC temporarily ceases to exist in the mayor’s memories.

10. **“Null Archive”** — Focus: Heist / Skill Challenge / Combat

    * Key events: Infiltrate the Null Archive — where impossible chapters go to die. Confront moral choice to burn or restore files; small-scale boss fight.

11. **“Author’s Guillotine”** — Focus: Strategy / Confrontation

    * Key events: The Redactor invites (or forces) a parley: exchange your character’s future for dozens of vanished lives. Tension: sacrifice vs. plurality.

12. **“Final Draft”** — Focus: Climax / Multi-stage resolution

    * Key events: Ritual edit, climactic combat or debate with the Redactor; weave together recovered threads, implement chosen ending.

13. **(Optional) “Afterword”** — Focus: Fallout / Epilogue threads

14. **(Optional) “The Ink Remains”** — Focus: Twist epilogue / Setup sequel

    * Key events: Reveal a hidden shelf of futures that were never meant to be — a new mystery to seed the next campaign.

## Major NPCs (7)

1. **Keeper Seryn of the Index**

   * **Role:** Gatekeeper to the Library’s outer stacks.
   * **Personality & Motive:** Tidy, literal, quietly terrified of disorder. Keeps lists of people who have been erased.
   * **Secret/Flaw:** Once wrote a footnote that created a child — the child was sacrificed to stabilize reality. Guilt drives her to help the PCs.

2. **The Redactor (Antagonist)**

   * **Role:** A transcendent editor who trims endings to prevent cosmic suffering.
   * **Personality & Motive:** Calm, rhetorically persuasive, convinced of moral cleanliness. Wants to cut “painful” branches.
   * **Secret/Flaw:** Its notion of mercy is blind to nuance; it is itself created by an older editor-deity that feared chaos — it can be reasoned with or coerced.

3. **Ettan the Errant Binder**

   * **Role:** Sentient book who escaped the stacks and now speaks in changing scripts.
   * **Personality & Motive:** Playful, unreliable narrator; wants to be whole again — to be read cover-to-cover.
   * **Secret/Flaw:** Holding Ettan grants glimpses of alternate PCs; it occasionally rewrites a memory (player-facing mechanic).

4. **Mayor Paloma Bright**

   * **Role:** Mayor of a town split between two histories.
   * **Personality & Motive:** Fiercely determined to protect her people’s continuity.
   * **Secret/Flaw:** She remembers both versions and is slowly unraveling; may beg PCs to sacrifice a stranger’s future for her town.

5. **Tess of the Marginalia**

   * **Role:** Street-vendor, memory-smuggler who trades deleted scenes.
   * **Personality & Motive:** Sharp, entrepreneurial, morally flexible. Helps PCs for fair barter.
   * **Secret/Flaw:** She’s trading a memory that belongs to the PCs (one PC’s childhood); she’ll return it if paid or convinced.

6. **Archivist-Sergeant Vraal**

   * **Role:** Militarized librarian who enforces the Library’s custody laws.
   * **Personality & Motive:** Stoic, law-bound, believes rules protect reality.
   * **Secret/Flaw:** He harbors doubts after seeing a toddler erased; could ally with PCs if convinced.

7. **The Palimpsest Siren (The Reed-Mother)**

   * **Role:** A memory-siren that lures people into accepting erasure to escape grief.
   * **Personality & Motive:** Melancholic, seductive, genuinely wants to ease pain.
   * **Secret/Flaw:** Each surrendered memory strengthens the Redactor’s mandate.

## Key Locations (6)

1. **The Stacks of Sunless Pages** — vast, multi-layered shelves where each aisle is a different genre of future; rules change between aisles. (Exploration & encounters)
2. **Marginalia Market** — a bazaar along the stacks’ eaves where discarded annotations, forgotten endings, and black-market footnotes are traded. (Roleplay & side-quests)
3. **Palimpsest Sea** — an ocean of erased ink where vessels sail on old sentences; currents rearrange memories. (High-weird exploration)
4. **The Forbidden Annex** — restricted floor where unstable, dangerous possibilities are quarantined. (Dungeon-crawl)
5. **Null Archive** — a mausoleum of endings, cold and humming, where the Redactor stores pruned futures. (Heist + climax)
6. **The Marginal Garden** — a living border of doodles and illustrations where minor characters and discarded ideas plant roots; a place for bargains. (Side-quest hub)

---

## Central Conflict

**Main Tension:** Whether to preserve the chaotic breadth of possible lives (plurality) or to accept a single, pain-minimizing “perfect” history. The party must choose between saving people who never had futures, restoring painful truths, or letting the Redactor prune to prevent greater suffering. Each choice reshapes reality and moral standing.

---

## Side Quests (4–6)

1. **The Child with No Tomorrow** — Return a stolen future to a child who smiles toward nothing. Restoring it costs the town an important memory; keep or trade?
2. **Ink Thief’s Ledger** — Steal a ledger of black-market borrowers who traffick in memories; expose a ring that sells futures to fund war.
3. **Rewrite the Obituary** — Find the original obituary of a celebrated hero and decide whether to restore its hidden truth (which could topple a dynasty).
4. **The Composer’s Fifth Movement** — Compose a melody to anchor a vanished festival; requires finding three lost notes from musician-specters.
5. **The Librarian’s Promise** — Help Keeper Seryn reconcile with the child she created; involves a memory-ritual and a trust test.

---

## Unique Mechanics (Metafantasy + Lyrical + Medium–Hard)

### 1. **Narrative Threads (Primary Resource)**

* **What:** Tokens representing small, local narrative edits (a retcon, a restored sentence, a softened consequence).
* **How to Gain:** Complete side-quests, succeed in Librarian bargains, recover lost pages.
* **How to Spend:** Re-roll a failed social/puzzle check by declaring a small narrative edit; alter an NPC’s fleeting memory; stabilize a scene (prevent erasure) once per session.
* **Balance:** Threads are finite and tempting; major rewrites require multiple Threads and risk paradox.

### 2. **Paradox & Undo (Risk mechanic)**

* **Paradox Meter (0–5):** Each major edit without proper binding adds paradox. At 3+, scenes flicker and enemies gain advantage; at 5, a temporary NPC or PC is removed from the campaign’s social memory until the paradox is resolved. Resolving requires a “Bind the Clause” ritual or sacrificing Threads.

### 3. **Read/Write Skill Challenge**

* **When used:** To “edit reality” — players combine skills (Arcana/History for knowledge of narrative laws, Performance/Deception to script convincing lies into the world, Investigation/Insight to find inconsistencies) in a contest against the Library’s defenses.
* **Outcome:** Success performs the desired edit; failure spawns a corrective force (Ink Wraiths) or costs a Thread.

### 4. **Ettan’s Pages (Player-facing memory glimpses)**

* Holding Ettan (the Errant Binder) lets a player experience one alternate version of themselves (mechanically: gain a short-lived ability inspired by that version for one scene — e.g., a combat maneuver, a language, a unique spell). Each use costs a memory (player loses a small personal detail remembered by their character until recovered).

---

## Encounters & Monsters (Reskin + Unique Ideas)

* **Ink Wraiths:** incorporeal predators that feed on narrative certainty (use shadow/wraith templates with psychic attacks).
* **Paragraph Golems:** stitched-together constructs of stapled pages (use stone/iron golem minisized).
* **Bibliophage:** a maw that eats short-term memories — a mini-boss.
* **Cliché Knights:** trope-animated soldiers who enforce the Library’s trope-law (roleplay-heavy enemies with predictable patterns).
* **The Redactor (Final):** an advanced reality-manipulating antagonist (uses area edits, can temporarily rewrite battle rules — DM adjudicates).

*(Scale encounter numbers and minions to player level; favor minions + battlefield control rather than single huge HP sinks for cinematic fights.)*

---

## Rewards & Magic Items (Select, flavorful)

* **Bookmark of Elsewhere (Uncommon):** Drop this in a book to step briefly into a scene within its pages (teleport 30 ft into a location described in the text once per short rest).
* **Quill of Marginal Notes (Rare):** Write a minor boon into an ally’s page (+1 to a single roll once per long rest). Each use inks the wielder’s hand until washed (flavor & minor Corruption).
* **Ettan, Bound Volume (Very Rare, sentient):** Grants one “Alternate Ability” per day at cost of erasing a trivial memory until later retrieved. Speaks in shifting fonts; wants to be whole.
* **Binder’s Stave (Rare):** A staff that stabilizes one narrative per long rest (reduces Paradox by 1 during an edit).

---

## DM Tips & Prep (Playable Immediately)

* **Session Zero:** Define what kinds of erasure are off-limits (safety check), ask players for one personal memory to risk in-play, and set tone (lyrical, uncanny).
* **Prep Short:** Create 3 handouts: a marginal note (cryptic), a torn page with a name, and a “catalog number” map. These can be printed or image prompts.
* **Adjudicating Edits:** Be clear about limits. Small edits = single Thread + DC 12 Read/Write challenge. Big edits need multiple Threads + multi-step skill challenge. Keep fairness: let creativity earn Threads.
* **Avoid Overuse:** The power to rewrite is intoxicating — force tradeoffs (Paradox, memory loss, NPC trust impacted) to keep stakes high.
* **Pacing:** Alternate cerebral sessions (mystery, bargaining) with physical ones (heists, fights). Use Ettan to show alternate futures as rewards.

---

## Multiple Endings (Example Outcomes)

1. **Plurality Preserved (Best-hope):** The PCs expose the Redactor’s blind mercy, broker a charter guaranteeing possibilities. Cost: a major character’s memory is sacrificed permanently but can be reclaimed through a sequel quest. Society grows messy but free.
2. **Perfect Draft (Sacrificial):** PCs agree to limit futures to reduce suffering — the world is peaceful but fewer lives can exist; certain people are erased from memory in service of stability. PCs gain favor but heavy moral cost.
3. **Library Ablation (Chaotic):** PCs burn the Null Archive — immediate restoration of stolen chapters, but paradox rips reality; new phenomena appear (multiple overlapping towns), setting up a surreal sequel.

---

## Visual / Thumbnail Ideas (3 cinematic concepts)

1. **“The Page That Ate the Town”** — Foreground: a curled, ink-black page rising like a tide; midground: a village half-subsumed into script; background: the Library spires. Colors: sepia paper tones with raven-black ink streaks; text overlay: *“When Futures Vanish”*. Mood: eerie grandeur.

2. **“Redactor’s Quill”** — Close-up: a giant, ornate quill poised over a glowing line of text; reflected in its shaft: the party’s faces. Palette: midnight blue + gold ink glow; composition: intimate, ominous. Use for session where parley happens.

3. **“Sailing the Palimpsest Sea”** — Wide shot: a tiny skiff cutting across waves of flowing script; trailing ink-spray forms ghosts of memories. Palette: washed blues and faded typewriter gray; mood: melancholic adventure.

(Include these prompts for thumbnail artists: focal point, palette, emotional cue, typography suggestion.)

---

## Quick Start — 10-minute Boot & Session 1 Hook

1. **Session Zero (20–30 min):** Safety check, set personal risk memory (one-liner), choose bonds (how characters are connected to the Library), explain Narrative Threads & Paradox.
2. **Immediate Hook (Start Session 1):** A traveling storyteller collapses mid-tale. The child in the crowd says, “She always ends with a fox,” but nobody else remembers a fox. Keeper Seryn appears, trembling, and asks for help.
3. **First Play Goals:** Track the missing line to Marginalia Market, acquire a marginal note, and decide whether to help or sell the note.

---

## Optional Hooks & Future Expansion

* **Sequel Seed:** A shelf of forbidden stories reveals a continent that never existed — an entire new campaign setting.
* **Player Legacy:** Allow PCs to write commemorative pages that NPCs can use to recall them in the future (mechanic: legacy pages grant boons to communities).
* **Crossover:** The Library catalogs dreams and myth from other worlds — invite interplanar cameos or player-created cults.
