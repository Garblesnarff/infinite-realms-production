Centuries after a magical cataclysm called the "Sundering" shattered the world into floating islands, civilization is just beginning to climb out of a dark age. The players are "Reclaimers," a new breed of adventurer who delves into the ruins of the technologically advanced "Sky-Builders" to recover lost knowledge. Hired by their village elder, they seek the three fragments of the Shattered Lens, a mythical artifact believed to have the power to stabilize the islands and begin healing the fractured world. Their journey will pit them against sky pirates, mutated beasts, and the lingering, chaotic magic of the Sundering itself.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A journey to rebuild a broken world.

*   **Act I — The First Ruin (Levels 1–4):** The players explore their first major Sky-Builder ruin, a crumbling observatory on a neighboring island. They learn the legend of the Shattered Lens and, after defeating its guardian, recover their most important piece of technology: a small, damaged, but functional skyship.
*   **Act II — The Sea of Clouds (Levels 5–9):** With their own vessel, the party becomes true explorers. They navigate the treacherous Sea of Clouds, visiting other isolated communities, battling sky pirates, and hunting for the remaining two fragments of the Lens, each hidden in a massive, dangerous dungeon from the Old World (e.g., a derelict military fortress, a silent university of magic).
*   **Act III — The Sundered Core (Levels 10–15):** The party assembles the Lens, only to discover it is not a tool, but a key. It reveals the location of the Sundered Core, the epicenter of the original cataclysm, a place of raw, unstable magic. Here, they must confront the "Echo of the Sundering"—a sentient magical storm—and use the Lens to either contain its power or destroy it, deciding the fate of the world.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Whispering Observatory”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Dungeon Crawl
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party is tasked by their village to explore a nearby ruin for salvage.
    *   They explore the crumbling observatory, solving simple puzzles and facing minor threats (rust monsters, automated defenses).
    *   In the main chamber, they find a small, dormant skyship and the first mention of the Shattered Lens.
**Escalation:** Activating the skyship awakens the observatory's guardian, a powerful but damaged Automaton (Warforged) who attacks them.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Pirate’s Nest”
*   **Focus:** Skyship Combat / Social
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party learns to fly their new skyship but quickly runs afoul of a notorious crew of sky pirates.
    *   After a tense chase or battle, they track the pirates to their hidden base, a hollowed-out asteroid known as "The Crow's Nest."
    *   They can either fight the pirate captain or negotiate with them, potentially turning a rival into a valuable, if untrustworthy, informant.
**Escalation:** The pirate captain has a crude map showing the location of a second Lens fragment, but will only part with it for a steep price or in exchange for a dangerous favor.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Silent University”
*   **Focus:** Mystery / Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party travels to the ruins of Aethelburg, a massive, abandoned university on a floating island.
    *   The second Lens fragment is held here, but the university is haunted by the psychic "echoes" of its former students and faculty, who endlessly repeat their last day.
    *   The party must navigate the haunted halls and solve a murder mystery from the past to appease a powerful spirit guarding the fragment.
**Escalation:** A rival crew of Reclaimers, funded by a shadowy benefactor, arrives at the university, creating a race to find the fragment first.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Elder Kaelen** — *The Mentor*
    *   **Role:** The wise and optimistic leader of the party's home village, Haven.
    *   **Personality:** A former Reclaimer himself, he is a well of knowledge about the Old World. He encourages the party's quest, believing the past holds the key to a better future.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** In his youth, his adventuring party was wiped out trying to retrieve a dangerous artifact. He has hidden this artifact beneath Haven, fearing its power but unable to bring himself to destroy it.

2.  **"Scrap-Talon" Skye** — *The Rival Pirate*
    *   **Role:** A charming, roguish skyship captain who is the party's primary rival in the Sea of Clouds.
    *   **Personality:** Confident, flamboyant, and opportunistic. She respects skill and daring, and sees the party as worthy competition. She might be an enemy one day and a begrudging ally the next.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is not just a pirate, but the exiled princess of a hidden, isolationist city-state. She is gathering resources to return and reclaim her throne.

3.  **The Archivist** — *The Guardian*
    *   **Role:** An ancient Automaton (Warforged) that guards the ruins of the Great Library of the Sky-Builders.
    *   **Personality:** Its memory banks are damaged. It speaks in a calm, monotone voice, but its speech is peppered with fragmented, out-of-context quotes from the millions of books it once curated. It is bound by its last directive: protect the knowledge.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Its core programming is in conflict. It knows the Lens fragment it guards is important, but it also recognizes the party's quest as being aligned with the library's goal of preserving knowledge. It can be convinced to stand down if the party can repair its logic circuits (a complex skill challenge).

## Key Locations

1.  **Haven:** The party's small, peaceful home village, built on a stable, green island.
2.  **The Sea of Clouds:** The vast, open sky between the islands, filled with strange weather, floating monsters (sky-whales, cloud-elementals), and pirates.
3.  **The Iron-Grip Fortress:** A derelict Sky-Builder military base on a storm-wracked island, home to one of the Lens fragments and still-active automated defenses.
4.  **The Sundered Core:** The epicenter of the cataclysm. A region of pure, chaotic magic where the laws of physics are broken and the sky bleeds raw arcane energy.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a story of hope, discovery, and the choice between preserving the past and building a new future. The central conflict is not with a single villain, but with the world's own broken nature. It is an optimistic take on the post-apocalypse, where the players are not just survivors, but architects of a new dawn.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Skyship**
*   The party's skyship, the *Odyssey* (or whatever they name it), is their mobile base and a customizable character in its own right. It has its own stats (HP, AC, Speed).
*   Players must manage its resources: **Aetherium Crystals** for fuel and **Salvaged Parts** for repairs.
*   They can use downtime and salvaged materials to upgrade the ship with new components: reinforced hull plating, faster engines, harpoon launchers, or even a small arcane cannon. These upgrades are crucial for surviving the dangers of the Sea of Clouds.

### 2. **Reverse Engineering**
*   The party will find complex, powerful artifacts from the Old World. To learn how to use or replicate them, they must **Reverse Engineer** the item during a long rest.
*   This is a multi-stage skill challenge requiring a series of successful Arcana, Investigation, and/or Tinker's Tools checks. The DC is based on the artifact's complexity.
*   **Success:** The party learns the item's properties and may gain a **Schematic** to craft more of them or build a related skyship upgrade.
*   **Failure:** The attempt fails, and a roll of 1 on any check might damage the artifact, drain its power, or cause a chaotic magical side-effect.
