### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Gilded Blight**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the smog-choked, clockwork city of Veridia, a mysterious affliction known as the "Gilded Blight" is slowly transforming citizens into living brass statues. The players, some of whom may be afflicted, must navigate a web of corporate espionage and political corruption to find the source of the plague. They uncover a conspiracy led by a ruthless industrialist who plans to use the blight to create a perfect, unthinking army and seize control of the city.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Veridia and the rise of Pneuma-Corp.
    *   Write the story of the inventor Silas "Sparkwright" Cogsworth and his falling out with Pneuma-Corp's director, Lord Alistair Finch.
    *   Describe the alchemical properties of the "Aurelian Solution" and how it causes the Gilded Blight transformation.
    *   Explain the social structure of Veridia, focusing on the tensions between the corporate elite and the factory workers.
    *   Detail a past industrial disaster in Veridia that shaped the city's current safety regulations (or lack thereof).

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Investigators (The Players)** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To find a cure for the Gilded Blight and expose the conspiracy behind it.
        *   **Hierarchy:** An independent group of concerned citizens, inventors, or investigators.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To understand the plague and help its victims.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To save themselves or their loved ones from the blight's progression.
        *   **Assets:** Their skills, the help of the disgraced inventor Silas, and any evidence they can gather.
        *   **Relationships:** Hunted by Pneuma-Corp; cautiously allied with Sergeant Vance of the city guard.
    *   **Pneuma-Corp** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To release an aerosolized form of the Gilded Blight and transform the city's populace into a controllable, automaton army.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A corporation led by the ruthless and brilliant Lord Alistair Finch.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To be the engine of Veridia's progress and prosperity.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To achieve ultimate power and create a "perfect," orderly society without free will.
        *   **Assets:** Vast wealth, a private army of clockwork automatons, control over the city's industry, advanced alchemical labs.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonists, viewing the players as a minor nuisance to be eliminated.
    *   **The City Guard** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To maintain order in a city on the brink of panic.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A standard city watch, but under-resourced and riddled with corporate corruption.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To enforce the law and quarantine the afflicted.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** High-ranking officers are on Pneuma-Corp's payroll, while beat cops like Sergeant Vance are suspicious but lack the power to act openly.
        *   **Assets:** Legal authority, a large number of guards (of varying loyalty), the city's armories.
        *   **Relationships:** An unreliable and internally conflicted faction that can be an obstacle or an ally, depending on who the players talk to.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player fails a Constitution saving throw against the Gilded Blight.
    *   **THEN:** The character gains a level of the Blight. Generate a short, descriptive scene of their transformation progressing, and apply the mechanical penalties.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully create a temporary suppressor for the Blight.
    *   **THEN:** They can pause the progression of the Blight for themselves or an ally, but the alchemical ingredients are rare, creating a new resource management challenge.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to trust Sergeant Vance and provide him with evidence of the conspiracy.
    *   **THEN:** Vance organizes a squad of loyal guards to help the party storm Pneuma-Corp tower in the finale. However, this alerts Finch that the City Guard is moving against him, causing him to increase his security.
    *   **IF:** The players fail to stop Finch from releasing the aerosolized Blight.
    *   **THEN:** The campaign's final act changes. It is no longer about preventing the disaster, but surviving it. Generate a new set of encounters focused on a desperate escape from a city that is rapidly turning to brass around them.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players get their hands on the Aurelian Solution.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a moral choice. Do they destroy it, use it to create a cure with Silas, or sell it to the highest bidder, becoming the very kind of people they were fighting against?
