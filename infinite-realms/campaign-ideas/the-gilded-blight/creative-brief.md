# Creative Brief: The Gilded Blight

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Stylized Steampunk (Arcane-inspired)

Inspired by the visually stunning and atmospheric aesthetic of the animated series *Arcane*. This style blends intricate steampunk machinery and Victorian-era design with a painterly, stylized realism. It aims to capture the gritty, smog-choked beauty of Veridia, the horror of the Gilded Blight, and the dramatic tension of corporate intrigue.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Focus on Atmosphere:** Describe the mood and feeling of the scene, emphasizing the industrial, often oppressive, environment.
*   **Detail the Mechanics:** Highlight the intricate gears, pipes, and clockwork elements that define the steampunk genre.
*   **Contrast and Juxtaposition:** Emphasize the contrast between the organic (characters, natural elements) and the mechanical, and between light and shadow.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, industrial, intricate, atmospheric, dramatic, stylized, dystopian, clockwork, transformative.
*   **Feeling:** A world of technological marvels and social decay. A sense of constant movement and hidden dangers. The beauty of invention is always tinged with the threat of its misuse.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic forms with a strong sense of volume and weight, but with stylized, expressive lines that define character and mechanical details. Edges can be sharp for machinery, softer for organic elements.
*   **Textures:** Rich, detailed textures that suggest age, wear, and material (e.g., polished brass, rusted iron, worn leather, fine fabrics).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed digital painting in the style of Arcane. The focus is on the intricate clockwork mechanisms of a steam-powered automaton, with every gear and rivet clearly defined."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Predominantly muted and desaturated, reflecting the smog and industrial grime. Dominant colors include deep browns, grays, metallic bronzes, and dark greens.
*   **Accent Colors:** Vibrant, glowing accents come from steam vents, arcane energy, or the unsettling sheen of the Gilded Blight (a bright, almost unnatural gold/brass). These accents should pop against the muted background.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Colors are heavily influenced by the dramatic, often low-key, lighting.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of industrial grays and rusted browns, dramatically illuminated by the glowing, almost liquid, brass of the Gilded Blight on a character's arm."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Human characters have realistic proportions but with expressive, slightly angular features. Clothing is Victorian-era inspired, but often practical, worn, and augmented with subtle mechanical elements (e.g., goggles, utility belts, prosthetic limbs).
*   **Automatons:** Designs range from elegant, clockwork servants to menacing, heavily armored enforcers. Gears, pistons, and steam vents are visible and functional.
*   **Gilded Blight:** The transformation should be depicted as a horrifying, yet strangely beautiful, process where flesh slowly becomes polished brass, with cracks and seams appearing on the skin.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A determined inventor with sharp, intelligent eyes and a grease-stained face, wearing a leather apron and goggles. His arm is slowly transforming into polished brass, with intricate gear-like patterns forming on the skin."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Towering, intricate industrial architecture. Buildings are often multi-layered, with sky-bridges connecting them. The city is a vertical landscape of metal, brick, and glass.
*   **Atmosphere:** Heavy with smog, steam, and the glow of furnaces. The air is thick and often hazy, creating a sense of depth and mystery.
*   **Details:** Exposed pipes, ventilation shafts, massive gears turning in the background, flickering gas lamps, and the constant presence of steam.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of the smog-choked city of Veridia at dusk. Towering, intricate clockwork buildings are connected by a network of sky-bridges, with steam rising from countless vents into the hazy, orange sky."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting with a strong emphasis on volumetric light (light rays cutting through fog/smog). Light sources are often industrial (furnaces, gas lamps, arc lights) or natural (sunlight struggling through smog).
*   **Shadows:** Deep, sharp shadows that create a sense of depth and conceal details, adding to the mystery and grit.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create mood, highlight key elements, and emphasize the scale of the industrial environment.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the harsh, orange glow of a distant furnace, casting long, sharp shadows across the factory floor. Volumetric light rays cut through the thick industrial smog."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic and often uses interesting angles (low-angle shots looking up at towering structures, high-angle shots looking down into bustling streets). Compositions should feel cinematic and purposeful.
*   **Techniques:** Use leading lines (pipes, bridges, streets) to guide the eye. Frame characters within architectural elements. Emphasize verticality and depth.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic, low-angle shot looking up at a character standing on a sky-bridge, silhouetted against the glowing, smoggy cityscape. The composition emphasizes the verticality and scale of the city."

## Voice

A cold, calculating male voice, smooth and precise, like the polished brass of a newly forged automaton. His British accent is crisp and authoritative, with a measured and deliberate pacing that conveys absolute control and a chilling lack of empathy. The emotion is a blend of intellectual superiority, ruthless ambition, and a subtle, almost imperceptible, hint of metallic resonance, as if the Gilded Blight itself is speaking through him. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, ambient hum of whirring gears and the distant, rhythmic clang of industry, emphasizing the pervasive mechanical influence. Role: The voice of the ruthless industrialist who unleashed the Gilded Blight, or a high-ranking member of the Cogwork Collective.
