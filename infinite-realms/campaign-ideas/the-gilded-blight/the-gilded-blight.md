    *   **Main Focus**: Puzzle Solving, Alliance
    *   **Key Events**: The party tracks down Silas to his secret workshop. They find him paranoid and potentially already succumbing to the Blight himself. He reveals that Alistair Finch stole his research on a revolutionary new power source and twisted it into the Gilded Blight, intending to use it to create an unthinking, automaton army. He will only help the party if they can prove their loyalty and assist with his counter-measure.

## Major NPCs

*   **Lord Alistair Finch**: The ruthless and brilliant director of Pneuma-Corp. He sees the citizens of Veridia as cogs in a machine and believes his Gilded Blight will bring about a perfect, orderly society under his control.
*   **Silas "Sparkwright" Cogsworth**: A disgraced but brilliant inventor, formerly of Pneuma-Corp. He is paranoid, obsessive, and driven by a desperate need for revenge against Finch for stealing his life's work.
*   **Sergeant Kaelen Vance**: A world-weary and pragmatic officer in the city guard. He is initially an obstacle to the party's investigation but can be convinced of the conspiracy, becoming a valuable ally with access to official resources.
*   **Madame Evelyn Reed**: The enigmatic and well-connected proprietor of the Brass Orchid. She knows many of the city's secrets and may be willing to trade information for the right price or service.
*   **Unit 734**: An advanced clockwork enforcer that serves as Finch's personal assassin and troubleshooter. It is relentless and single-minded in its pursuit of anyone threatening Pneuma-Corp's interests.

## Key Locations

*   **The Gear-Tooth Tenements**: An overpopulated and smog-filled residential district, home to the city's factory workers and the initial epicenter of the Gilded Blight outbreak.
*   **Pneuma-Corp Factorum**: A massive industrial complex filled with deafening machinery, dangerous chemicals, and automaton workers. It houses a secret alchemical lab in its sub-basement.
*   **The Brass Orchid**: An opulent and exclusive club where Veridia's elite gather to indulge in forbidden pleasures and make back-door deals.
*   **Silas's Clockwork Menagerie**: A hidden workshop filled with half-finished inventions, complex schematics, and ticking clocks. It is both a sanctuary and a prison for its paranoid creator.
*   **Pneuma-Corp Tower**: The gleaming brass and glass headquarters of Finch's empire. It is a symbol of progress and a fortress of corporate power, with its upper floors being a luxurious death trap for intruders.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a struggle between humanity and an unnatural, industrial "progress." The party must not only fight to save themselves and the city from a literal transformation into unthinking machines but also confront the dehumanizing nature of unchecked ambition and corporate greed that birthed the Gilded Blight.

## Side Quests

*   **A Cure for a Friend**: An ally or contact of the party is in the advanced stages of the Gilded Blight. The party must acquire rare alchemical components from a dangerous part of the city to create a temporary suppressor with Silas's help.
*   **The Whistleblower**: A low-level Pneuma-Corp employee has evidence of Finch's illegal experiments but is being hunted by Unit 734. The party must protect them and escort them to Sergeant Vance to secure his aid.
*   **The Sabotaged Shipyard**: A rival corporation's airship docks have been sabotaged, and they blame Pneuma-Corp. The party can investigate to earn a favor, finding that a third party is trying to sow chaos.
*   **The Black Market Schematics**: Silas needs a specific, rare component for his counter-measure, the schematics for which are being sold at a black market auction in the city's underbelly. The party must either buy, steal, or fight for them.

## Unique Mechanics

*   **The Gilded Blight Progression**: Any character exposed to the Blight must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they gain a level of the Blight.
    *   **Level 1**: A small, metallic sheen appears on the character's skin. They have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks as the metal scrapes.
    *   **Level 2**: One of their limbs becomes partially gilded. They cannot add their proficiency bonus to ability checks made with that limb.
    *   **Level 3**: Their speed is halved, and they have disadvantage on all Dexterity saving throws as their joints begin to stiffen.
    *   **Level 4**: The character's transformation is complete. They become a brass statue, effectively dead until a cure can be found.
    *   This condition cannot be removed by normal magical means, only by a specific alchemical cure that the party must work to create. This adds a personal and time-sensitive element to their quest.

*   **Invention and Salvage**: To reflect the steampunk setting, players can salvage parts from defeated automatons and scrap piles. These parts, along with a successful Tinker's Tools check, can be used to craft simple gadgets, upgrade their own gear, or be given to Silas in exchange for more advanced equipment. This encourages creative problem-solving beyond combat.
