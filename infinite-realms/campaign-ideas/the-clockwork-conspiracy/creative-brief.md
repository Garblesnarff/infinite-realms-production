# Creative Brief: The Clockwork Conspiracy

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Painterly Industrial Steampunk (Dishonored-inspired)

Inspired by the unique aesthetic of the *Dishonored* video game series, this style blends a painterly, atmospheric realism with the intricate, functional designs of steampunk technology. It aims to capture the gritty, conspiratorial, and inventive spirit of Cogsworth, a city where steam and gears drive both progress and hidden plots.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Atmosphere and Mood:** Describe the feeling of the scene, focusing on the industrial, often oppressive, yet strangely beautiful environment.
*   **Detail the Mechanics:** Highlight the intricate gears, pipes, steam vents, and clockwork elements that define the steampunk genre, ensuring they look functional and worn.
*   **Character and Environment Interaction:** Show how characters interact with and are shaped by their industrial surroundings.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Gritty, industrial, conspiratorial, atmospheric, painterly, inventive, revolutionary, Victorian-era, clockwork.
*   **Feeling:** A city of stark contrasts: opulence and squalor, innovation and decay, order and rebellion. A sense of constant surveillance and hidden agendas. The beauty of intricate machinery is always present, but often tinged with grime and the weight of its purpose.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic forms with a strong sense of volume and weight, rendered with a painterly quality. Lines are often implied by brushstrokes and the edges of light and shadow, rather than sharp outlines.
*   **Textures:** Rich, detailed textures that suggest age, wear, and material (e.g., rusted iron, polished brass, worn leather, grimy brick, fine but slightly faded fabrics).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in the style of Dishonored. The focus is on the intricate, grimy details of a steam-powered automaton, with visible brushstrokes and a strong sense of metallic texture."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Predominantly muted and desaturated, reflecting the industrial smog and grime. Dominant colors include deep browns, grays, metallic bronzes, dark greens, and muted blues.
*   **Accent Colors:** Strategic pops of color come from glowing arcane devices, gas lamps, the warm glow of furnaces, or specific, worn elements of character clothing. These accents should be used sparingly to draw attention.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Colors are heavily influenced by the dramatic, often low-key, lighting, creating deep shadows and subtle color shifts.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of industrial grays and deep browns, dramatically illuminated by the warm, flickering glow of a gas lamp and the faint, arcane blue light from a hidden device."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Human characters have realistic proportions but with slightly exaggerated, expressive features that convey their personality and the hardships of their world. Clothing is Victorian-era inspired, practical, worn, and often augmented with functional steampunk gadgets.
*   **Automatons:** Designs are intricate and functional, showcasing visible gears, pistons, and steam vents. They should look powerful and imposing, but also clearly mechanical, not organic.
*   **Expression:** Faces are often serious, determined, or wary, reflecting the conspiratorial tone. Body language is key to conveying hidden motives or tension.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A grizzled inventor with a stern, determined expression and a grease-stained face, wearing a patched leather coat and heavy goggles. His hand rests on a complex, brass-plated device."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Towering, intricate industrial architecture, often with a gothic or Victorian influence. Buildings are multi-layered, with visible pipes, vents, and steam. The city is a vertical landscape of metal, brick, and stone.
*   **Atmosphere:** Heavy with smog, steam, and the constant hum of machinery. The air is thick and often hazy, creating a sense of depth and mystery.
*   **Details:** Exposed pipes, ventilation shafts, massive gears turning in the background, flickering gas lamps, and the constant presence of steam. The contrast between opulent upper districts and the grimy Underworks should be clear.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of the smog-choked industrial district of Cogsworth at night. Towering, gothic-inspired factories belch steam into the hazy sky, and the streets below are lit by flickering gas lamps."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting with a strong emphasis on volumetric light (light rays cutting through fog/smog). Light sources are often industrial (furnaces, gas lamps, arc lights) or natural (moonlight struggling through smog).
*   **Shadows:** Deep, sharp shadows that create a sense of depth and conceal details, adding to the mystery and grit. Shadows are used to hide threats and emphasize the conspiratorial nature of the campaign.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create mood, highlight key elements, and emphasize the scale of the industrial environment, often creating a sense of unease or tension.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the harsh, orange glow of a distant furnace, casting long, sharp shadows across the factory floor. Volumetric light rays cut through the thick industrial smog, revealing only glimpses of the machinery."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic and often uses interesting angles (low-angle shots looking up at towering structures, high-angle shots looking down into bustling streets). Compositions should feel cinematic and purposeful, often creating a sense of being watched or of hidden depths.
*   **Techniques:** Use leading lines (pipes, bridges, streets) to guide the eye. Frame characters within architectural elements. Emphasize verticality and depth. Silhouettes against steam or light sources can be very effective.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic, low-angle shot looking up at a character standing on a grimy rooftop, silhouetted against the glowing, steam-filled cityscape. The composition emphasizes the verticality and scale of the city, with a sense of hidden eyes watching."

## Voice

A gravelly, middle-aged male voice, like the grinding of rusty gears or the hiss of escaping steam. His British accent (perhaps a working-class Cockney or a grimy Northern dialect) is sharp and conspiratorial, with a fast, nervous pacing that hints at hidden agendas and constant surveillance. The emotion is a blend of cynical distrust, simmering anger, and a desperate, almost manic, revolutionary fervor. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, but with a pervasive, low-frequency hum of machinery and the faint, ambient ticking of countless clockwork devices. Role: A revolutionary pamphleteer, a disgruntled inventor, or a spy from the grimy Underworks of Cogsworth.
