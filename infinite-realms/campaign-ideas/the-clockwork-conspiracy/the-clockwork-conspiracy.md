In the smog-choked, steam-powered city of Cogsworth, the party—a group of inventors, revolutionaries, and adventurers—uncovers a plot by the city's powerful Artificer's Guild to replace key political figures with clockwork automatons. The Guildmaster believes that his creations are superior to the flawed and emotional humans who currently rule the city. The party must navigate a web of political intrigue, corporate espionage, and mechanical monstrosities to expose the conspiracy and prevent a silent, clockwork coup.

## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** A mix of combat with clockwork constructs, social encounters with the city's elite, and challenges that require clever use of technology and invention.
*   **Investigation:** The party will need to gather clues, follow leads, and piece together the conspiracy. This will involve everything from attending high-society balls to breaking into the workshops of the Artificer's Guild.
*   **Consequences:** The party's actions will have a direct impact on the political landscape of Cogsworth. If they are too reckless, they could be branded as criminals and hunted by the city guard. If they are too slow, the Guild's plan will succeed.

*   **Act II — The Gears of Power (Sessions 3–5):** The party delves deeper into the conspiracy, uncovering the extent of the Guild's plot. They must identify which of the city's leaders have been replaced and find a way to prove it.
*   **Act III — The Uprising (Sessions 6–8):** The party has the evidence they need, but the Guild is on to them. They must rally support from the city's other factions and expose the conspiracy before the Guild can silence them for good.

## Key Locations

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a battle for the soul of Cogsworth. It is a struggle between the messy, unpredictable nature of humanity and the cold, logical perfection of the machine. The party must not only stop a conspiracy, but also grapple with the question of what it means to be human in an increasingly technological world.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Invention System**

*   Players can use their skills and resources to invent their own gadgets and devices. This could be anything from a simple grappling hook to a complex clockwork spy drone.
*   **Crafting:** Inventions can be crafted using a combination of skill checks (e.g., Tinker's Tools, Arcana) and rare components that the party must find or purchase.

### 2. **Reputation System**

*   The party's actions will affect their reputation with the various factions of Cogsworth (e.g., the City Council, the Artificer's Guild, the criminal underworld, the working class).
*   **Effects:** A high reputation with a faction can unlock new allies, resources, and information. A low reputation can lead to new enemies and obstacles.

### 3. **Clockwork Automatons**

*   The clockwork automatons are not just mindless drones. They are cunning and adaptable, and they learn from their encounters with the party. As the campaign progresses, the automatons will become more challenging, with new abilities and tactics.
