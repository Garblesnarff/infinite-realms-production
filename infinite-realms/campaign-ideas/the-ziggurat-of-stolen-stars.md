Chosen by the goddess Inanna, the players must find the hidden path to the Ziggurat of Annun, a cosmic stairway to the heavens.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A divine quest to ascend to the heavens.

*   **Act I — The Starless Age (Sessions 1–5):** The players witness the chaos of the starless world and are chosen by their divine patron. They must decipher ancient prophecies to locate the invisible Ziggurat and prove their worth to its gatekeeper.
*   **Act II — The Seven Terraces (Sessions 6–14):** The party ascends the Ziggurat, with each terrace representing a different layer of the heavens and presenting a unique challenge. They will battle celestial beasts, solve divine puzzles, and meet forgotten demigods bound to the Ziggurat's service.
*   **Act III — The Apex of Heaven (Sessions 15–20):** The party reaches the celestial palace of Marduk. They must navigate the god's labyrinthine home, confront him in a climactic battle, and decide the fate of the Tablets of Destiny—whether to simply return them or rewrite a new destiny for the world below.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a high-fantasy epic about restoring cosmic balance. It pits mortals against the machinations of a god, forcing them to act on a divine scale. The central conflict is a test of heroism: are the players merely pawns of a goddess, or can they rise to become legends in their own right and make a choice that is best for the mortal world, not just the gods?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Constellation Aspects**
*   As the party progresses, they will find and release the stolen constellations. Once a constellation is freed, the party can choose to **attune to its Aspect** during a long rest.
*   Only one Aspect can be active per player at a time. Examples:
    *   **Aspect of the Lion:** Once per day, you can let out a roar that frightens all enemies within 30 feet (Wisdom save to resist).
    *   **Aspect of the River:** You gain a swim speed of 40 feet and can breathe underwater.
    *   **Aspect of the Hunter:** You gain advantage on all survival checks made to track a creature.

### 2. **Divine Trials**
*   Each of the Ziggurat's seven terraces is a unique, large-scale puzzle or environmental challenge, not just a series of combat encounters.
*   Examples:
    *   **The Terrace of Mirrors:** A maze of reflective surfaces where illusions are real and gaze attacks are everywhere. Players must navigate by sound and touch.
    *   **The Terrace of Silence:** A realm where no sound can be made. All communication must be non-verbal, and spells with verbal components automatically fail unless cast using a special, sign-language-based system.
