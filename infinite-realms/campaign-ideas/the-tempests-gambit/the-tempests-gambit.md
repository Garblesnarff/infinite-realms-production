# The Tempest's Gambit

## Real-World Basis: Operation Popeye
During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force ran a highly classified weather modification program called Operation Popeye. From 1967 to 1972, they conducted cloud seeding operations over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, successfully increasing rainfall by up to 30%. The goal was to soften road surfaces, cause landslides, and generally disrupt enemy logistics through weather warfare.

## D&D Twist
Two rival kingdoms, locked in a brutal war of attrition, have reached a stalemate. One kingdom, in a desperate move, has assembled a powerful conclave of storm sorcerers and druids to perform "The Tempest's Gambit." They are no longer predicting the weather; they are creating it. Endless, targeted rain turns battlefields into impassable mud. Unnatural fog banks hide the movement of entire battalions. Assassins are dispatched not with daggers, but with pinpoint lightning strikes called from a clear sky. The tactic is working, but the casters are losing control. Their massive ritual is tearing the veil to the Plane of Air, and the weather itself is gaining a malevolent sentience.

## Campaign Premise (Military Fantasy/Environmental Epic)
The players are a squad of soldiers, mercenaries, or spies operating on the front lines of this war. They are given a seemingly straightforward mission—scout an enemy position, deliver a message, rescue a captured officer—but it is immediately complicated by bizarre, unnatural weather. They might be hunted by a living thunderstorm or find their path blocked by a flash flood in the middle of a drought. They soon realize that the weather itself is being used as a weapon, and it's an indiscriminate one. The players must journey deep into the heart of the kingdom responsible (which could even be their own), locate the hidden site where the conclave performs its ritual, and stop them. The casters, however, are hailed as heroes who are winning the war and will not stop willingly. The players must navigate the complexities of military command, survive the magically-charged superstorms, and perhaps even bargain with an enraged Air Elemental prince who has been drawn into the conflict.

## Key Elements
*   **The Weather as an Enemy:** The environment is an active and hostile force. The DM can create unique weather events as combat encounters or exploration challenges. Imagine a "lightning elemental" that leaps between puddles, or a "fog horror" that attempts to suffocate the players.
*   **A War of Moral Grays:** The antagonists are not necessarily evil. The druids and sorcerers of the Tempest's Gambit believe they are saving their people from a bloody war. The players must confront the question: does the end justify the means? Do they side with their nation, or with the balance of nature?
*   **Epic Set Pieces:** This campaign is built for large-scale, cinematic moments. A siege where the attackers must contend with a targeted hurricane. A naval battle where both sides are fighting a sentient waterspout. A final confrontation in the eye of a magical superstorm.
*   **Planar Consequences:** The ritual is damaging the border with the Plane of Air. This can lead to Air Elementals and other airborne creatures being unwillingly pulled into the Material Plane, creating new, unpredictable threats and potential allies.

## Tone
*Apocalypse Now* meets the Weather Channel. A military fantasy campaign with an epic, environmental scope, where players are caught between their duty as soldiers and the terrifying consequences of unchecked magical power.
