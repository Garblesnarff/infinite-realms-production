**Campaign Type / Genre:** Time Travel / Action-Adventure
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **9** → Finish **13–14**
**Tone (keywords):** high-octane, paradoxical, epic, chaotic, mind-bending
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party is a team of elite temporal agents, recruited from across time and space to protect the timeline from those who would seek to rewrite it for their own selfish ends. Their first mission: to stop the rogue chronomancer, Malachi, who is traveling through history, altering key events and causing devastating paradoxes. The party must chase Malachi across time, from the primeval jungles of the dinosaur age to the gleaming spires of the far future, all while trying to fix the damage he has caused and avoid unraveling reality itself.

## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat will be fast-paced and varied, as the party will be fighting everything from dinosaurs to futuristic robots. The party will also face challenges that require them to use their knowledge of history and their wits to solve problems without resorting to violence.
*   **Paradoxes:** The party's actions can have unforeseen consequences. If they are not careful, they could accidentally alter the timeline in ways that are even worse than what Malachi has done. The DM will track a "Paradox Level" that can introduce complications and strange effects.
*   **Consequences:** Failure to stop Malachi could result in the complete unraveling of the timeline, leading to a reality too bizarre and chaotic to comprehend. The party is the last line of defense for history as we know it.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A three-act arc that takes the party on a wild ride through time.

*   **Act I — The Anomaly (Sessions 1–2):** The party is recruited by the Temporal Concordance and sent on their first mission: to investigate a temporal anomaly in the recent past. They discover that the anomaly was caused by Malachi and get their first taste of his reality-bending power.
*   **Act II — The Chase (Sessions 3–5):** The party pursues Malachi across time, from one historical era to the next. They must repair the damage he has caused while trying to anticipate his next move.
*   **Act III — The End of Time (Sessions 6–8):** The chase leads the party to the End of Time, a point beyond which reality ceases to exist. Here, Malachi plans to use the energy of the collapsing timeline to rewrite history from the very beginning. The party must stop him in a final, epic confrontation.

2.  **The Past:** The party will visit a variety of historical eras, from ancient Rome to the Wild West.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a battle for the fate of history itself. It is a story about the temptation of power, the consequences of playing God, and the idea that even the smallest change can have a ripple effect across time. The party must not only stop a madman, but also grapple with the ethical and philosophical implications of their own actions.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Paradox Level**

*   The DM will track a Paradox Level, which starts at 0. Certain actions (e.g., leaving a piece of modern technology in the past, killing someone who was supposed to live, giving someone information about their own future) will increase the Paradox Level.
*   **Effects:** As the Paradox Level increases, strange and unpredictable things will begin to happen. The party might encounter people who remember them from a future they haven't experienced yet, or they might find that their own personal histories are beginning to change.

### 2. **Temporal Abilities**

*   As temporal agents, the party has access to a variety of special abilities that allow them to manipulate time. These could include the ability to slow down time, to see a few seconds into the future, or to create a temporal duplicate of themselves.

### 3. **Historical Research**

*   Before each jump to a new time period, the party will have the opportunity to do some historical research. This will give them valuable information about the era they are about to visit, which can help them to blend in, to anticipate events, and to avoid causing paradoxes.
