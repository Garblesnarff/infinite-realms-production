# Creative Brief: The Ashen Blight

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Horror & Cosmic Dread

Inspired by the oppressive, decaying, and beautiful worlds of games like *Dark Souls*, *Bloodborne*, and the art of Zdzisław Beksiński. This style is meant to evoke a sense of grit, unforgiving reality, and cosmic horror. The world is ancient, crumbling, and haunted by things beyond mortal comprehension.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Atmosphere is Key:** Focus on describing the feeling of the scene. Use words like "oppressive," "suffocating," "ancient," "dread-filled," and "hauntingly beautiful."
*   **Texture and Detail:** Emphasize the textures of the world. Everything is decaying. Describe the "crumbling stone," "splintered wood," "rusted metal," and "diseased, peeling flesh."
*   **Cinematic Language:** Use photographic and cinematic terms to define the composition and lighting.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Grimdark, gothic horror, cosmic dread, oppressive, desolate, atmospheric, haunting, melancholic.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of hopelessness and struggle against an inevitable, creeping doom. The world is beautiful in its decay. There should be a palpable weight to the atmosphere.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** This is a realistic, detailed style. Focus on form, texture, and light rather than outlines. Lines should be suggested by the edges of shadows and the texture of surfaces.
*   **Form:** Emphasize strong, heavy silhouettes, especially for architecture and large creatures.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A photorealistic and highly detailed digital painting. The focus is on the texture and form, with sharp, defined details in the crumbling stonework..."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Heavily desaturated and monochromatic. Dominated by shades of grey, charcoal, deep brown, and murky green. 
*   **Accent Colors:** Use color sparingly and with purpose. A splash of deep crimson for blood, a sickly yellow-green for blight and poison, or a cold, pale blue for ethereal magic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a heavily desaturated and monochromatic color palette, dominated by shades of ash and stone, with a single, striking accent of blood-red."

**4. Character & Creature Design:**
*   **Shapes:** Characters are often gaunt, weary, and clad in practical, worn gear. Creatures are twisted and asymmetrical, their forms corrupted by the blight. Body horror is a key element.
*   **Details:** Emphasize the physical toll of the world. Scars, dirt, torn clothing, and signs of the blight (e.g., greyish skin, weeping sores, unnatural growths).
*   **Creatures:** Designs should be nightmarish and unsettling. Combine familiar anatomy in unnatural ways. Think of flesh stretched over bone, extra limbs, and faces contorted in silent screams.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A gaunt knight in worn, dented plate armor, his face etched with exhaustion. A Blighted Beast, once a wolf, now a skeletal horror with stretched skin, multiple eyes, and thorny protrusions growing from its back."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Gothic and brutalist architecture. Grand, crumbling structures that speak of a forgotten, more prosperous age. Nature is either dead or actively hostile and corrupted.
*   **Details:** Fog, mist, and heavy rain are common. Jagged rocks, dead trees with claw-like branches, and murky, stagnant water. The sky is perpetually overcast and oppressive.
*   **Prompt Example:** "The scene is a rain-slicked, narrow alley in a gothic city, with towering, oppressive architecture looming on all sides. A faint, sickly green light emanates from a sewer grate."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** High-contrast, dramatic lighting (chiaroscuro). Deep, dark shadows that obscure detail and create a sense of the unknown. Light sources are often weak and isolated (a single torch, a sliver of moonlight).
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create suspense, dread, and to guide the eye. It should feel naturalistic but highly dramatic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by a single, flickering torch, casting long, dancing shadows. The lighting is dramatic and high-contrast, in the style of chiaroscuro, with much of the scene lost in deep blackness."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Cinematic and often unsettling. Use wide shots to emphasize the scale of the oppressive environment, and tight, claustrophobic shots for intense encounters.
*   **Focus:** Often places the character as a small figure in a vast, intimidating landscape, emphasizing their vulnerability.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a lone figure standing before the entrance to a colossal, crumbling temple, dwarfed by its scale. The composition should create a sense of awe and dread."

## Voice

A dry, rasping, whispery, gender-neutral voice, like the rustle of dead leaves skittering across a forgotten tombstone. The pacing is slow and deliberate, each word drawn out with a chilling, unsettling slowness, as if the very air is heavy with decay. The emotion is a profound, ancient despair, a quiet horror that seeps into the listener's bones. Audio quality is close-miked, with a dry, crackling texture and a pervasive, cold echo that suggests vast, empty catacombs and the mournful sigh of a dying world. Role: The disembodied voice of the blight itself, or a scholar reading from a forbidden, decaying tome.
