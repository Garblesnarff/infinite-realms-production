## Campaign Overview

*   **Title**: The Ashen Blight
*   **Campaign Type/Genre**: Dark Fantasy
*   **Estimated Length**: A short campaign of 6-8 sessions.
*   **Player Level Range**: Starting at Level 3, ending around Level 8.
*   **Tone**: Unforgiving, morally ambiguous, resource-scarce, and consequential.
*   **Core Premise**: In a world already worn down by war and famine, a mysterious plague known as the Ashen Blight begins to ravage the remote barony of Vyrnholm. The affliction doesn't just kill; it twists and corrupts all life it touches, turning men into monsters and forests into graveyards. The players are drawn into the heart of this decay, tasked with finding a cure—or at least a way to survive—before the blight consumes everything.

## Story Arc

The narrative is designed as a three-act structure that escalates from a local crisis to a world-altering threat over 6-8 sessions.

*   **Act I: The Outbreak (Sessions 1-2)**: The party arrives in a blighted village and witnesses the horror of the plague firsthand. They must survive the initial chaos, fighting off twisted wildlife and desperate locals, eventually discovering that the plague is not a natural phenomenon but a deliberate curse spreading from a corrupted heart deep within the nearby woods.
*   **Act II: The Conspiracy (Sessions 3-5)**: Following the trail of corruption, the party uncovers a death cult known as the Ashen Disciples. They learn the cult is not merely worshipping the blight but actively spreading it under the patronage of a secret benefactor. This arc takes them from the wilderness into the decaying city of Greyport, where they must navigate a web of secrets and lies to identify the cult's leader.
*   **Act III: The Bitter End (Sessions 6-8)**: The party discovers the blight emanates from an ancient, sunken temple where the cult plans to complete a ritual to summon the blight's patron entity. To stop them, the characters must brave the temple's deadly traps and guardians and confront the cult's master. The campaign culminates in a difficult choice: stopping the blight may require a terrible sacrifice, and victory will not cleanse the scars left on the land or their souls.

## Session Breakdown

*   **Session 1: The Hamlet of Oakhaven**
    *   **Focus**: Investigation, Survival
    *   **Key Events**: The party arrives in the quarantined hamlet of Oakhaven, where the Ashen Blight is rampant. They must scavenge for supplies, aid a desperate local healer, and defend the town's crumbling barricades from Blighted Beasts—once-normal animals now twisted into aggressive monsters.

*   **Session 2: The Weeping Wood**
    *   **Focus**: Exploration, Combat
    *   **Key Events**: The party tracks the source of the Blighted Beasts into the Weeping Wood, a forest actively dying from the plague. They discover a Blighted Treant that serves as a focal point for the corruption. Destroying it reveals the curse is artificial and leads them toward the city of Greyport.

*   **Session 3: Whispers in Greyport**
    *   **Focus**: Social, Investigation
    *   **Key Events**: In the grim city of Greyport, the party must navigate the Underside, the city's slum district. They gather rumors about the Ashen Disciples and must earn the trust of the suspicious locals or the city's underworld to find the cult's hidden lair.

*   **Session 4: The Baron's Masquerade**
    *   **Focus**: Social, Infiltration
    *   **Key Events**: The investigation points to the influential Baron Valerius Thorne, who is hosting an opulent masquerade. The party must infiltrate the heavily guarded Thorne Manor during the party, seeking proof of his connection to the cult without raising suspicion. The session climaxes with the discovery of a sacrificial altar hidden beneath the manor.

*   **Session 5: The Sunken Temple**
    *   **Focus**: Dungeon Crawl, Puzzle-Solving
    *   **Key Events**: Evidence from the manor leads the party to the Sunken Temple of Nalthur, a long-forgotten holy site. The party must navigate flooded chambers, bypass ancient traps, and defeat undead guardians animated by the blight's power.

*   **Session 6: The Heart of the Blight**
    *   **Focus**: Combat, Moral Choice
    *   **Key Events**: The party reaches the temple's inner sanctum, interrupting the final stages of the ritual. They confront Baron Thorne, now a powerful Blighted monstrosity. After defeating him, they learn that the ritual's final component is an innocent child, and stopping the blight may require sacrificing the child or finding a costly alternative.

*   **Session 7: The Ashen Dawn**
    *   **Focus**: Climax, Combat
    *   **Key Events**: Regardless of their choice, the party must contend with the avatar of the blight's patron entity. This final battle is a desperate struggle against a powerful foe in a rapidly corrupting environment. Their success stops the blight's spread, but the barony of Vyrnholm is left a desolate, haunted wasteland.

*   **Session 8 (Optional): Scraps of Hope**
    *   **Focus**: Epilogue, Social
    *   **Key Events**: The campaign concludes with an exploration of the consequences. The party witnesses the aftermath of their actions, helps the few remaining survivors establish a new settlement, and reckons with the personal cost of their victory.

## Major NPCs

    *   **Personality & Motivations**: Driven by a desperate need to save her community, she is losing hope.
    *   **Secrets**: She knows her poultices only slow the blight's advance and is secretly studying forbidden texts for a real cure.

*   **Ser Kaelan the Disgraced (Fallen Knight)**: A former holy knight now working as a sellsword in Greyport.
    *   **Personality & Motivations**: Cynical and drowning his sorrows in ale, he seeks redemption for a past failure that allowed a great evil to fester.
    *   **Flaws**: He suffers from debilitating guilt and is initially unwilling to commit to any cause.

*   **Marrow (Skitter-kin Chief)**: The shrewd leader of a clan of rat-like humanoids living in Greyport's sewers.
    *   **Personality & Motivations**: Cares only for the survival and prosperity of his clan.
    *   **Shifting Loyalties**: He will ally with the party to push the Ashen Disciples out of his territory but will betray them if a better opportunity arises.

*   **Baron Valerius Thorne (Secret Antagonist)**: A charismatic and ruthless noble who secretly leads the Ashen Disciples.
    *   **Personality & Motivations**: Believes the world is decadent and must be purged by the Ashen Blight to make way for a new, stronger era.

*   **The Voice of Nalthur (Cosmic Entity)**: The ancient, whispering presence that is the source of the Ashen Blight.
    *   **Personality & Motivations**: An entity of decay and unnatural cycles, it sees civilization as a wound upon the world that must be sterilized.

## Key Locations

*   **Oakhaven**: The dying hamlet where the campaign begins. Its features include a makeshift infirmary in the local temple, collapsed farmhouses, and hastily built barricades.
*   **The Weeping Wood**: A supernaturally tainted forest. Black, viscous sap weeps from sickly trees, the air is thick with spores, and the wildlife has been twisted into ravenous predators.
*   **Greyport**: A bleak, rain-slicked city rife with poverty and corruption. Key areas include the Underside slums, the opulent Noble's Crest district, and the sprawling, mazelike sewer system.
*   **Thorne Manor**: Baron Valerius's magnificent estate, known for its pristine gardens and grand halls. Below lies a network of cold, stone cellars used for the cult's dark rituals.
*   **The Sunken Temple of Nalthur**: An ancient complex dedicated to a forgotten god of decay, now partially submerged in a murky swamp. Its crumbling halls are filled with waterlogged undead, magical traps, and the oppressive psychic aura of the blight's master.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a struggle for survival against a **cosmic horror** manifesting as an unnatural plague. The party is in a constant race against time, as the Ashen Blight is not just an enemy to be fought but an environmental hazard that slowly drains resources, corrupts the soul, and turns the world itself against the players.

## Side Quests

*   **The Last Seedling**: An old druid hermit asks the party to venture to the heart of the Weeping Wood to rescue a single, uncorrupted sapling of a Silverwood tree, said to be a key to one day restoring the forest.
*   **Atonement in Steel**: Ser Kaelan asks for help reclaiming his blessed ancestral sword from the leader of a cutthroat gang in Greyport. He believes he cannot face the coming darkness without it.
*   **A Healer's Burden**: Elara has lost contact with a fellow healer who was experimenting with a dangerous ritual to grant himself immunity. She asks the party to find his hidden lab in the woods, fearing what he may have become.
*   **The Rat's Maze**: Marrow offers the party a shortcut through the sewers to the Sunken Temple in exchange for clearing out a rival Skitter-kin tribe that has fully embraced the Ashen Blight.

## Unique Mechanics

*   **Difficulty - Hard**: This campaign is designed to be challenging. Resources are scarce, enemies are intelligent, and retreat is often the wisest option. To represent this, the DM should use the **Gritty Realism** rest variant (DMG, p. 267), where a short rest is 8 hours and a long rest is 7 days. This makes hit dice and spell slots far more valuable resources.

*   **Genre & Tone - Dark Fantasy & Gritty**:
    *   **Corruption Track**: Characters can gain Corruption points when they fail a Constitution saving throw after being exposed to a major source of the blight (e.g., the breath weapon of a Blighted Beast, drinking tainted water, being struck by certain cultist spells).
        *   **Effect**: Each point of Corruption imposes a cumulative -1 penalty on all saving throws.
        *   **Manifestations**: At 3 Corruption, the character develops a minor physical flaw (e.g., weeping sores, a milky eye). At 5 Corruption, they gain a form of long-term madness. At 8 Corruption, they risk becoming a Blighted monster if they fall unconscious.
        *   **Removal**: Corruption is extremely difficult to remove, requiring powerful magic like *Greater Restoration* or completing a major story objective that cleanses a source of the blight.
