**Title:** The Flesh-Weaver's Lament
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Grimdark / Body Horror / Investigation
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **11–12**
**Tone (keywords):** grotesque, grim, desperate, horrific, tense
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
A horrific plague, the "Crimson Weave," is spreading across the land. It doesn't kill, but rather merges living creatures—people, animals, and plants—into grotesque, multi-souled abominations known as "Amalgams." The players are a band of "Stitch-Hunters," specialists sanctioned by a desperate state to hunt these monstrosities and uncover the plague's source. They must follow the trail of corrupted flesh, all while the very essence of the plague threatens to unravel their own bodies and minds.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions)

A desperate hunt for the source of a world-ending plague.

*   **Act I — The Silent Village (Sessions 1–3):** The party is dispatched to investigate a village that has gone dark. They discover the inhabitants have been fused into a single, building-sized Amalgam, and must enter it to find a clue to the plague's origin.
*   **Act II — The Thread of Corruption (Sessions 4–7):** Following the plague's trail, the party travels through blighted lands, facing increasingly intelligent and powerful Amalgams. They learn the plague is not mindless, but is being guided by a single, malevolent will.
*   **Act III — The Weaver's Sanctum (Sessions 8–12):** The trail leads to a remote, mountaintop monastery. Here they find the plague's source: a former cleric of life, driven mad by grief, who is using a corrupted divine artifact to try and merge all life into a single, unified consciousness, thereby ending the suffering of individuals.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Oakhaven Mass”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives at the village of Oakhaven to find it eerily silent and covered in pulsating, red, vein-like growths.
    *   They discover the entire village and its inhabitants have been fused into a single, massive, semi-sentient entity (The Oakhaven Mass).
    *   They must venture inside the fleshy interior of the Mass to find the village's elder, who holds a clue to where the plague came from.
**Escalation:** The Mass begins to "give birth" to smaller, mobile Amalgams to defend itself.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Whispering Chorus”
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Psychological Horror
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party begins to hear the psychic echoes of the minds trapped within the Amalgams.
    *   They encounter an Amalgam that retains some of its former intelligence, a fused group of scholars who can communicate telepathically.
    *   This "Whispering Chorus" provides cryptic clues, pointing towards a figure they call "The Weaver" and a location upriver.
**Escalation:** The psychic feedback from the Whispering Chorus becomes overwhelming, forcing the players to make Wisdom saving throws to avoid short-term madness.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Beast of the Weeping River”
*   **Focus:** Wilderness / Monster Hunt
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party tracks the plague's spread up a corrupted river.
    *   They are hunted by a massive Amalgam made from a dozen crocodiles, a giant serpent, and a river barge, which is terrorizing the waterway.
    *   They must set a trap and defeat the beast to continue their journey.
**Escalation:** During the fight, the Amalgam speaks with the voice of the Flesh-Weaver, taunting them and revealing that the plague is adapting to their tactics.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Inquisitor Valerius** — *The Cold Employer*
    *   **Role:** The grim, pragmatic Inquisitor who hires the party and provides them with resources.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, detached, and focused only on results. He sees the party as a necessary, if disposable, tool.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His family was among the first victims of the plague. His cold demeanor is a mask for his all-consuming grief and rage, and he will sacrifice anything and anyone to see the plague's source destroyed.

2.  **Elara, the Severed** — *The Living Clue*
    *   **Role:** A young woman who was partially fused with her pet wolf before being surgically separated by the Inquisition. She has a painful, psychic link to the Crimson Weave.
    *   **Personality:** Traumatized, quiet, and prone to sudden, violent outbursts. She is terrified of her own body.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her connection to the Weave allows the Flesh-Weaver to see through her eyes. The closer she is to the party, the more the villain knows of their plans.

3.  **The Flesh-Weaver (Brother Alistair)** — *The Antagonist*
    *   **Role:** A former high-ranking cleric of a god of life and healing, now the source of the plague.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, serene, and speaks with a gentle, paternal tone. He genuinely believes he is ending suffering by creating a single, unified being, and he sees the party's actions as a cruel attempt to preserve the agony of individuality.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The artifact he is using is also consuming him. He is slowly being absorbed into his own creation, and a part of him is terrified of this and wants to be stopped.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a struggle for identity against a force that seeks to erase it through a horrifying, twisted form of unity. It explores themes of grief, loss, bodily autonomy, and the philosophical question of whether a life without individual suffering is worth the price of selfhood. The party must not only fight monsters, but also confront the seductive, nihilistic philosophy behind their creation.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Crimson Weave Corruption**
*   Whenever a player is hit by a critical hit from an Amalgam or fails a saving throw against a plague-related effect, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of **Corruption**.
*   At levels 1, 3, and 5 of Corruption, the player rolls on a **Mutation** table. Mutations grant a dark power and a corresponding flaw.
    *   *Example: Your eyes multiply across your face. You gain advantage on Perception checks, but have disadvantage on saves against being frightened.*
*   A character who reaches 6 levels of Corruption becomes a monstrous NPC under the DM's control.
*   Corruption can only be removed by powerful, experimental magic found later in the campaign.

### 2. **Amalgam Core-Souls**
*   Major Amalgams are complex bosses that are more than just a bag of hit points. They are composed of multiple creatures, and their consciousness is stored in **Core Souls**.
*   The Amalgam is immune or resistant to most damage until a Core Soul is exposed. Players can use called shots (at a higher AC) to target specific body parts, or solve an environmental puzzle to reveal a Core Soul.
*   Destroying a Core Soul might remove one of the Amalgam's attacks, disable a regeneration ability, or create a new weakness, turning the boss fight into a dynamic, multi-stage puzzle.
