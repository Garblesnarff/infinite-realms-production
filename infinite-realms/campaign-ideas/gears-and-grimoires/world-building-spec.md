**Gears & Grimoires: The Cogwheel Conspiracy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the sprawling industrial city of Cogwheel Harbor, magic and machinery exist in an uneasy alliance, where enchanted automatons labor alongside human workers and spell-powered factories churn out wonders of magitech engineering. When a series of "accidents" begins befalling prominent citizens, the players discover a conspiracy to replace free will with mechanical obedience through a dangerous new form of mind-controlling magitech. As investigators, whistleblowers, or concerned citizens, they must navigate the city's labyrinthine politics, corporate espionage, and revolutionary undercurrents to expose the conspiracy. But as they delve deeper into the mystery, they discover that the real threat isn't just control—it's the fundamental question of what it means to be human in a world where magic and machines are becoming indistinguishable.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of Cogwheel Harbor and the discovery of magitech - the fusion of mechanical engineering and magical principles.
    *   Write the history of the Great Industrial Revolution that transformed the city from a small port town to an industrial powerhouse.
    *   Describe the development of magitech mind-control technology and the ethical debates surrounding human augmentation.
    *   Explain the social divide between the corporate elite in their spires and the workers in the factory districts.
    *   Detail the various worker uprisings and revolutionary movements that have shaped the city's political landscape.
    *   Write about the "Augmented Rights" movement and the fight for recognition of mechanically and magically enhanced individuals.

        *   **Hierarchy:** Council of augmented individuals from various social classes.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Augmentation is the next step in human evolution and should be celebrated, not feared.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To ensure that augmentation technology remains accessible to all, not just the elite.
        *   **Assets:** Legal expertise, augmented abilities, network of sympathetic medical professionals.
