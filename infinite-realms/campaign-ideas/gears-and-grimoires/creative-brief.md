# Creative Brief: Gears & Grimoires: The Cogwheel Conspiracy

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Industrial Steampunk Fantasy (Final Fantasy meets Bioshock)

Inspired by the intricate machinery and atmospheric industrial design of games like *Final Fantasy VII* and *Bioshock*. This style aims to capture the gritty beauty, innovative wonder, and underlying tension of Cogwheel Harbor, where Victorian-era aesthetics meet magical industrialization in a world of brass, steam, and spellwork.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Industrial Grandeur:** Focus on the scale and intricacy of magitech engineering, from massive factory complexes to delicate mechanical implants.
*   **Blend Magic and Machinery:** Highlight the seamless integration of spellwork with mechanical systems, creating visually striking combinations of organic magic and rigid machinery.
*   **Atmospheric Tension:** Use lighting, composition, and color to convey the underlying social and ethical tensions beneath the surface of industrial progress.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Innovative, industrial, discovery-focused, tense, revolutionary, gritty, wondrous, conflicted.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of awe at human (and magical) ingenuity mixed with unease about its consequences. The atmosphere should evoke the thrill of discovery and the weight of ethical responsibility. The world feels like a powder keg of progress and revolution.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Precise, technical line work for mechanical elements combined with flowing, organic lines for magical effects and steam clouds.
*   **Forms:** Massive industrial structures with intricate details, characters with practical workwear augmented by magical and mechanical enhancements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Final Fantasy meets Bioshock, focusing on a sprawling factory complex where brass machinery and glowing magical runes work in unison."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich industrial colors of burnished brass, deep copper, and polished steel accented by magical blues, greens, and purples. Weathered and oil-stained surfaces show the grit of industrial life.
*   **Luminosity:** Dramatic lighting from forge fires, electrical arcs, and magical energy sources that cast long shadows and create striking contrasts.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...an industrial color palette of burnished brass and deep copper, accented by the electric blue glow of magical energy and the warm orange of molten metal."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Practical industrial clothing - leather aprons, brass goggles, work boots - enhanced with magical elements like glowing runes or mechanical prosthetics. Characters show signs of their environment: oil stains, burn scars, determined expressions.
*   **Magitech Elements:** Visible mechanical augmentations that blend seamlessly with the body, from clockwork limbs to spell-etched implants.
*   **Expression:** Faces show the wear of industrial life - determination, suspicion, revolutionary fire, quiet desperation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A factory worker with brass mechanical arms covered in glowing magical runes, wearing a leather apron stained with oil and enchanted ink, their face determined beneath brass welding goggles."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast industrial landscapes with towering factory complexes, smoke-filled skies, and streets crowded with steam carriages and spell-powered vehicles. Interiors feature intricate machinery and alchemical laboratories.
*   **Atmosphere:** Always bustling with activity - hissing steam, clanking machinery, shouted orders, humming magical fields. The environment tells stories of progress and exploitation.
*   **Details:** Industrial clutter that serves as world-building - discarded prototype parts, revolutionary graffiti, surveillance devices disguised as street lamps, workers' personal touches on their workstations.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of Cogwheel Harbor at dusk, massive factory smokestacks belching enchanted steam, streets filled with brass automatons and spell-powered carriages, the Corporate Spire towering over the industrial district."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic industrial lighting with strong contrasts between bright magical energy sources and deep mechanical shadows. Light sources create realistic lighting on metallic surfaces and atmospheric effects on steam and smoke.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, geometric shadows cast by machinery that occasionally pulse with magical energy, creating an sense of underlying power and tension.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes both the wonder of magitech innovation and the human cost of progress, with warm forge light for moments of creation and cold magical glow for scenes of ethical dilemma.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the blue glow of magical forges and the warm orange of molten metal, casting long shadows from towering machinery that emphasize the scale and tension of industrial progress."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, sweeping shots to show industrial scale and intimate close-ups for character details and magitech intricacies. Leading lines follow steam pipes, magical energy flows, or revolutionary symbols.
*   **Techniques:** Rule of thirds placing characters against massive industrial backdrops, dynamic angles for action sequences, symmetrical compositions for formal corporate settings.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, imposing shot of the Grand Factory Complex, the composition using converging steam pipes and magical energy streams to draw the eye to a lone worker standing before the massive industrial heart of the facility."

## Voice

A gravelly, authoritative voice with the clipped precision of an industrial foreman who's seen too many "accidents" covered up. The narrator's standard American accent carries a subtle mechanical undertone, with measured pacing that builds tension through technical details and dramatic reveals. The emotion is one of grim determination and underlying anger, as if exposing a conspiracy that the speaker has long suspected. Audio quality features industrial environmental ambience - hissing steam, clanking machinery, the hum of magical fields, the distant shouts of workers. Role: The voice of a whistleblower, or the reluctant chronicler of progress's dark side.
