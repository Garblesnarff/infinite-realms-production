# The Leviathan's Labyrinth

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Biological Horror / Exploration / Survival
- **Estimated Length**: 10-12 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-8
- **Tone**: Claustrophobic, Visceral, Mysterious, Desperate

### Core Premise
The players find themselves shipwrecked or stranded on what they initially believe to be a strange, mountainous island. They soon discover, to their horror, that they are inside a colossal, living leviathan – a creature so vast that entire ecosystems, strange flora, and unique fauna have evolved within its organs and tissues. The leviathan is slowly dying, and its internal systems are failing, causing tremors, acid floods, and the collapse of its internal structures. The players must navigate this biological labyrinth, seeking a way to escape before the creature's demise becomes their own.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Belly of the Beast (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players awaken within the leviathan's digestive tract or a similar internal cavity. They must quickly learn the rules of this biological dungeon, identify its dangers (acidic pools, digestive enzymes, internal parasites), and find a way to move deeper into the creature's body, seeking a more stable environment.

**Act 2: The Organ Crawl (Sessions 4-8)**
- The party explores various organs, each a unique biome: the pulsating Heart-Chamber, the acidic Stomach-Caverns, the vast Lung-Forests, or the intricate Brain-Maze. They encounter indigenous life forms, some hostile, some symbiotic, and discover signs of previous inhabitants or explorers who have left behind clues or warnings.

**Act 3: The Escape (Sessions 9-12)**
- The leviathan's condition worsens, triggering catastrophic internal events. The players discover a potential escape route – perhaps through a massive wound, a natural orifice, or by manipulating the creature's biology to force an expulsion. They must race against time, battling the leviathan's failing defenses and the creatures that feed on its dying body, to reach freedom.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Shipwrecked & Swallowed**: The players wake up disoriented inside a strange, fleshy cavern. Initial exploration reveals the biological nature of their surroundings. They must find fresh water and a safe place to rest.
- **Session 2: The Acidic Flow**: Navigating through a region of digestive fluids, they encounter their first internal parasites – creatures adapted to this environment. They find a path leading deeper.
- **Session 3: The Ribcage Grotto**: A relatively stable cavern formed by the creature's ribs. They find evidence of previous inhabitants (a crude camp, ancient carvings) and learn the leviathan is dying.
- **Session 4-5: The Lung-Forests**: A vast, oxygen-rich chamber filled with strange, fungal-like flora and airborne creatures. They might find a way to communicate with the leviathan's nervous system.
- **Session 6-7: The Heart-Chamber**: A massive, pulsating chamber. The players must navigate its rhythmic contractions and avoid being crushed. They might encounter a creature that feeds on the leviathan's life force.
- **Session 8: The Brain-Maze**: A complex, neural network of pathways. Here, they might experience psychic echoes of the leviathan's thoughts and memories, revealing its history or a potential escape route.
- **Session 9-10: Cataclysmic Collapse**: The leviathan suffers a major internal failure (e.g., a lung collapses, the heart seizes). The players must navigate a rapidly changing, dangerous environment towards their escape route.
- **Session 11-12: The Great Expulsion**: A final, desperate dash through a natural orifice or a self-inflicted wound. They face the leviathan's last defenses and the creatures trying to escape alongside them. The campaign ends with their dramatic emergence into the open sea or sky.

### Major NPCs

- **The Leviathan (as an entity)**: The creature itself. **Role**: Environment / Antagonist / Unwitting Ally. **Personality**: Ancient, dying, its thoughts are alien and vast, expressed through tremors and biological reactions. **Flaw/Secret**: It is not inherently malicious, merely a dying organism. Its pain and fear are what cause many of the dangers.
- **Dr. Myra Vellum**: A mad xenobiologist who has been living inside the leviathan for years, studying its internal ecosystem. **Role**: Guide / Obsessive. **Personality**: Brilliant but unhinged, she sees the leviathan as her life's work and is reluctant to leave. **Flaw/Secret**: She believes she can save the leviathan and will sabotage any escape attempts if she thinks it will harm her "patient."
- **The Sanguine Stalker**: A highly evolved predator native to the leviathan's circulatory system. **Role**: Recurring Antagonist. **Personality**: Instinctual, relentless, and perfectly adapted to its environment. **Flaw/Secret**: It is blind and hunts purely by vibration and scent, making stealth a viable tactic against it.

### Key Locations

- **The Esophageal Chasm**: A vast, dark tube leading deeper into the creature, lined with cilia and mucous membranes.
- **The Bile Pools**: Caverns filled with corrosive fluids, home to unique, acid-resistant life forms.
- **The Nerve Clusters**: Areas where the leviathan's nervous system is exposed, pulsing with bio-electricity and psychic energy.
- **The Skin-Vent**: A massive, scarred opening on the leviathan's exterior, a potential escape route.

### Central Conflict
The ultimate survival challenge against a dying, colossal organism. The players must overcome environmental hazards, internal predators, and the creature's own biological processes to escape its living prison.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Biological Hazards & Adaptation**: The environment itself is the primary antagonist. Players must contend with constantly changing conditions: fluctuating oxygen levels, corrosive fluids, seismic tremors from internal spasms, and the spread of internal infections. They might gain temporary "biological adaptations" (e.g., resistance to acid, enhanced senses in darkness, temporary regeneration) by consuming certain internal flora or fauna, or by undergoing strange symbiotic mutations. However, these adaptations might come with side effects or require constant upkeep, forcing players to make difficult choices about how much they are willing to change to survive.
