## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10–12 sessions)

A three-act arc of investigation, martial combat, and elemental balancing.

*   **Act I — The Five Seals (Sessions 1–4):** Following the assassination, the party is tasked by the surviving masters to reinforce the five seals. Each seal is located in a remote, dangerous location, and each is being targeted by elemental creatures and the assassin's allies.
*   **Act II — The Trail of the Shadow Fist (Sessions 5–8):** The party gathers clues about the assassin's identity, leading them away from the monastery and into the corrupt heart of a nearby port city. They must navigate the city's criminal underworld and political factions, all of whom seem to have a connection to the forbidden "Shadow Fist" style.
*   **Act III — The Unbalanced Gate (Sessions 9–12):** The party unmasks the assassin, a former master of their own order who believes the world has become stagnant and needs to be purified by the raw power of the Elemental Chaos. The party must confront their fallen master at the Unbalanced Gate itself as the final seal shatters.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Master Jin** — *The Fallen Master*
    *   **Role:** The primary antagonist and the assassin. He was once the most respected master at the monastery after the Grand Master.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, disciplined, and utterly convinced of the righteousness of his cause. He sees his actions not as evil, but as a necessary, painful correction.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He did not kill the Grand Master in anger, but in a ritual duel. The Grand Master accepted the duel, knowing he would lose, as a final lesson for his students.

2.  **Lady Xiang** — *The Syndicate Boss*
    *   **Role:** The ruthless leader of the Jade-Eyed Serpent and Master Jin's primary worldly agent.
    *   **Personality:** Ambitious, pragmatic, and charming. She sees the Elemental Chaos as a new, untapped market.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is not loyal to Master Jin. She plans to betray him and seize control of the Unbalanced Gate for her own purposes.

3.  **Brother Kai** — *The Rival Disciple*
    *   **Role:** A fellow senior disciple at the monastery who is jealous of the party's favor with the masters.
    *   **Personality:** Arrogant, talented, and confrontational. He believes he should have been chosen for the quest.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His jealousy is so strong that he can be manipulated into hindering the party, and may even be tempted by the teachings of the Shadow Fist style.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of tradition vs. change, and the nature of balance. It pits the party's disciplined, defensive philosophy against a radical, aggressive one. The central conflict is a battle for the soul of their order and the fate of the world, forcing the players to question whether perfect balance is worth maintaining if it leads to stagnation.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Chi & Stances**
*   Instead of (or in addition to) Ki points, Monk players (and potentially others who train at the monastery) use **Chi Dice** (d8s).
*   Chi Dice can be spent to fuel special abilities, but they are also used to enter powerful **Stances**.
*   Each Stance (e.g., *Stance of the Unmoving Mountain*, *Stance of the Rushing River*) provides a unique set of offensive and defensive benefits, but has a specific condition for maintaining it (e.g., *You cannot move more than 10 feet in a turn*).
*   This encourages tactical, fluid combat that mirrors the ebb and flow of a martial arts film.

### 2. **Elemental Imbalance**
*   As the seals weaken, the world becomes more elementally imbalanced. The DM tracks which seals are weakest.
*   This can have environmental effects (e.g., if the Fire Seal is weak, the region becomes hotter and prone to wildfires) and magical effects (fire spells are empowered, while water spells are weakened).
*   This creates a dynamic world and a tangible sense of urgency for the players to restore the seals.
