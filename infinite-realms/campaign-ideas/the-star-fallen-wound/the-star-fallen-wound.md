# The Star-Fallen Wound

## Real-World Basis: The Tunguska Event
In 1908, a colossal, mysterious explosion occurred in a remote part of Siberia, flattening over 80 million trees across 2,000 square kilometers. The blast was estimated to be 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb at Hiroshima. The leading theory is the air burst of a meteor, but no impact crater has ever been found.

## D&D Twist
It wasn't a meteor. It was a "splinter" of the Far Realm, a physical piece of a dimension of madness, that crashed into the world. The explosion was the sound of reality breaking. The area, now known as the "Star-Fallen Wound" or the "Tunguska Gage," is a crater of alien flora and fauna where the laws of physics are warped. Gravity can shift, time flows like water, and the landscape itself is a living, hostile entity. The very air is saturated with psionic radiation that twists minds and bodies.

## Campaign Premise (Planar Horror/Weird West)
Decades after the "Star-Fall," the Wound is a quarantined zone, a vast, unnatural wilderness in the world's northernmost reaches (akin to Icewind Dale or a fantasy Siberia). Local druids and rangers have kept a fragile peace, but now the quarantine is failing. Aberrations—creatures twisted beyond recognition, as well as classic horrors like Beholders, Mind Flayers, and Star Spawn—are emerging in greater numbers. The players are hired by a desperate consortium of rulers or scholars to venture into the Wound, find its "heart," and seal the planar breach. Their journey will be a descent into madness, where they must protect their own sanity as much as their lives while navigating a landscape that actively defies logic.

## Key Elements
*   **A Hostile, Alien Landscape:** The Wound is a zone of constant weirdness. Trees are made of shifting crystal, rivers flow uphill, and the sky is filled with alien constellations. The environment itself is a character and a constant threat.
*   **Sanity as a Resource:** Drawing inspiration from cosmic horror, the campaign should feature a Sanity or Madness mechanic. Witnessing the impossible, battling aberrations, and exposure to the Wound's influence will slowly erode the players' minds, leading to phobias, manias, and dangerous psychic mutations.
*   **Aberrant Horrors:** The primary enemies are aberrations. This is a chance to use D&D's most bizarre and terrifying monsters. Creatures might have unnatural abilities, like inflicting madness or warping the battlefield around them.
*   **The Heart of the Wound:** At the center of the crater is the crashed splinter of the Far Realm itself—a non-euclidean labyrinth of flesh, crystal, and thought. The final act of the campaign would be a dungeon crawl through this impossible space to perform a ritual of sealing.

## Tone
*Annihilation* meets *Stalker* in a D&D setting. A grim, high-lethality exploration campaign focusing on cosmic horror, survival, and the fragility of the mind.
