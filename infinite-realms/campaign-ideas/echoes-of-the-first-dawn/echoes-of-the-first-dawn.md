## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A journey of survival against a primal world.

*   **Act I — The Ashfall (Sessions 1–5):** The party's homeland is destroyed, and they must guide the survivors of their tribe through ash-choked lands. They will hunt strange beasts, contend with rival predators, and learn the first, dangerous whispers of wild magic.
*   **Act II — The Great River (Sessions 6–12):** The tribe reaches a massive, uncrossable river. The party must explore its banks, seeking a safe passage while dealing with territorial lizardfolk tribes, navigating treacherous rapids, and uncovering more ruins of the silent precursors.
*   **Act III — The Promised Valley (Sessions 13–20):** Having crossed the river, the party leads their people into a new valley. But it is not empty. They must confront the valley's current master—a hyper-intelligent Tyrannosaurus Rex that wields primitive psychic power—and claim their new home.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Mountain’s Roar”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Survival
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The campaign begins with the eruption of the great mountain, forcing the party to flee with the handful of survivors from their tribe.
    *   They must navigate a landscape transformed by ash, finding clean water and safe shelter.
    *   Their first hunt: a pair of giant, flightless birds (Axe Beaks).
**Escalation:** A pack of Sabertooth Tigers, also displaced by the eruption, has begun stalking the tribe.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Whispering Monoliths”
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Mystery
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party discovers a field of strange, humming monoliths left by the precursor race.
    *   Interacting with the monoliths awakens a latent magical ability in one of the players (or an NPC), introducing the first taste of magic to their world.
    *   They must defend the tribe from a territorial Dire Bear that uses the monoliths as its den.
**Escalation:** The monoliths activate, projecting a cryptic star-map into the sky that seems to point the way forward, but also attracts the attention of stranger, more alien creatures.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Lizard King’s Decree”
*   **Focus:** Social / Faction Conflict
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party reaches the Great River and finds it controlled by a powerful tribe of Lizardfolk.
    *   The Lizard King demands a tribute: the tribe's "fire-bringer" (a skilled elder) and their secret of making fire.
    *   The party must negotiate, find an alternative tribute, or challenge the Lizard King's champion in ritual combat.
**Escalation:** A splinter faction of Lizardfolk, who worship a giant crocodile, attempts to sabotage negotiations and offer the tribe up as a sacrifice.

    *   **Role:** The tribe's elder and oral historian. She holds the map and guides the tribe's spiritual beliefs.
    *   **Personality:** Wise, patient, but deeply pragmatic. She has seen too many winters to be an optimist.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She believes the precursors were gods and that their ruins are holy sites, a belief that may lead the tribe into danger.

2.  **Koth, the Lone Hunter** — *The Rival*
    *   **Role:** A strong, proud hunter who believes the tribe should be led by strength, not shamans or explorers.
    *   **Personality:** Arrogant, aggressive, and deeply skilled in tracking and hunting. He challenges the party's decisions at every turn.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He was the sole survivor of a previous expedition that was wiped out by a monster he is too terrified to speak of. His aggression is a mask for his fear.

3.  **S'slath, the River-Speaker** — *The Lizardfolk Shaman*
    *   **Role:** The ambitious shaman of the Great River lizardfolk tribe.
    *   **Personality:** Cunning, serpentine, and speaks in riddles. He is more intelligent and worldly than his kin.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is about survival in its most primal form. It pits the nascent spark of civilization against a brutal, untamed world. The central conflict is the struggle to not just survive, but to keep the tribe's culture, knowledge, and hope alive in the face of overwhelming adversity.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Resource & Tribe Management**
*   The party is responsible for the well-being of their tribe (a group of 20-30 NPCs). They must track **Food** and **Morale**.
*   **Food:** Gathered through hunting, foraging, and fishing. Each tribe member consumes one unit of food per day. Starvation leads to exhaustion and loss of morale.
*   **Morale:** A score from 1 to 10. High morale provides boons (e.g., NPCs are more helpful, crafting is faster). Low morale leads to dissent, infighting, and the risk of tribe members abandoning the group. Morale is raised by successful hunts, finding safe shelter, and discovering wonders. It is lowered by death, starvation, and encountering terrifying monsters.

### 2. **Primal Magic**
*   Standard Vancian magic (spell slots) does not exist. Instead, spellcasters use a more dangerous, primal form of magic.
*   When a caster attempts a spell, they describe their intent and make a check using their spellcasting ability. The DC is determined by the spell's level (10 + spell level).
*   **Success:** The spell is cast.
*   **Failure:** The spell fails, and the caster rolls on a **Primal Magic Surge** table. Surges can range from harmless cosmetic effects to summoning a hostile elemental or taking necrotic damage.
