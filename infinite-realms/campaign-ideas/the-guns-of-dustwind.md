In the sun-scorched territory of Dustwind, the party—a posse of gunslingers, prospectors, and outcasts—finds themselves in the middle of a range war between a ruthless cattle baron and a tribe of native warriors who can commune with the spirits of the land. The discovery of a new, powerful magical resource, ghost rock, has brought tensions to a boiling point. The party must choose a side, or play both against the middle, as they navigate a land of six-shooters and sorcery, where a quick draw is as important as a powerful spell.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Gunslinging**

*   The campaign will feature rules for classic western shootouts, including rules for cover, called shots, and duels. Spells and magical abilities can be used in conjunction with firearms, allowing for a unique blend of fantasy and western action.

### 2. **Reputation**

*   The party will earn a reputation based on their actions. This reputation can be positive (e.g., heroes, lawmen) or negative (e.g., outlaws, villains). A character's reputation will affect how NPCs react to them, and it can open up new opportunities or close old doors.

### 3. **Ghost Rock**

*   Ghost rock is a powerful and dangerous new resource. It can be used to power strange new technologies, to create powerful magical items, or as a potent ingredient in spells. However, it is also a source of corruption, and prolonged exposure to it can have unpredictable and monstrous effects.
