They take on the cases that no one else will touch, defending the innocent and prosecuting the guilty in a legal system that is struggling to keep up with the complexities of magical crime.

## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The campaign will feature a mix of courtroom battles, which are run as a series of social skill challenges, and out-of-court encounters, which can range from investigating a crime scene to fending off an attack from a magical assassin.
*   **Investigation:** The party will need to be sharp-witted and resourceful to succeed. They will have to gather evidence, interview witnesses, and find loopholes in the law. The truth is often hidden, and the party will have to dig deep to find it.
*   **Consequences:** The party's actions will have a direct impact on the lives of their clients and the balance of justice in the city. A lost case can mean a wrongful conviction, a guilty party going free, or a dangerous precedent being set.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Courtroom Combat**

*   The trial is run as a series of social combat encounters. The party must use their social skills to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and make persuasive arguments to the jury. The prosecution will do the same, and the outcome of each encounter will be determined by a series of contested skill checks.

### 2. **Evidence and Clues**

*   The party will need to gather evidence to support their case. Evidence can be physical objects, witness testimony, or magical forensics. The DM should create a system for tracking evidence and for presenting it in court.

### 3. **Legal Precedents**

*   The law in Veritas is based on a complex system of legal precedents. The party can research these precedents to find loopholes and arguments that they can use in court. This can be run as a series of skill challenges, with the party making checks in skills like Investigation, History, and Arcana.
