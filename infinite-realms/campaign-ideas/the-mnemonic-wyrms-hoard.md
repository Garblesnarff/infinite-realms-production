The secret to defeating the Blighted Lords, an unstoppable undead army, was lost a generation ago when the ancient dragon Xylos consumed the memory of it. Now, with the last free city about to fall, a desperate council has hired the players for an impossible heist. They must not steal gold, but a memory. Using a dangerous ritual, they will project their minds into the dragon's vast, dream-like consciousness—a living dungeon of forgotten history—to find and extract the lost knowledge before the world forgets how to fight back.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A heist into the mind of a dragon.

*   **Act I — The Plan (Sessions 1–2):** The party is hired by a mysterious benefactor. They must gather the rare components for the psychic projection ritual: a scale from the target dragon, a tear from a creature of pure joy (a unicorn), and a psychic echo from a place where a great memory was lost.
*   **Act II — The Mindscape (Sessions 3–6):** The ritual is performed, and the players enter the dragon's mind—a surreal, shifting labyrinth of its memories. They must navigate treacherous mental landscapes (the volcanic field of its birth, the crystalline forest of its first kill), evade the dragon's psychic defenses ("Mnemonic Sentinels"), and battle personified emotions like Rage and Sorrow.
*   **Act III — The Extraction (Sessions 7–10):** The party locates the "Archive of Consumed Lore" where the target memory is stored. They must defeat the memory's guardian—a psychic echo of the dragon itself—and escape the collapsing mindscape as the real Xylos begins to wake up and purge the intruders from its consciousness.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Contract”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Heist Planning
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party is assembled by the Curator, a mysterious spymaster, and briefed on the mission.
    *   They are given their first task: acquire a scale from Xylos. This requires them to sneak into the dragon's physical lair while it sleeps, a tense stealth mission.
**Escalation:** The dragon stirs in its sleep, its dreams manifesting as minor, physical tremors and illusions in the real world, threatening to expose the party.

### Sessions 2-3 — “The Sea of Regret”
*   **Focus:** Entering the Mindscape / Surreal Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The ritual is completed, and the party awakens on a stormy, black sea within the dragon's mind: its collected regrets.
    *   They must navigate the sea, which is filled with the ghostly echoes of those the dragon has killed.
    *   They must find the "Isle of a Forgotten Name," a memory of the first creature Xylos ever failed to defeat.
**Escalation:** A colossal, shadowy figure formed of pure regret—the dragon's personified guilt over a past failure—rises from the sea to attack the party.

### Sessions 4-6 — “The Library of Lives”
*   **Focus:** Puzzle Solving / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party reaches the dragon's main memory palace, a vast, silent library where each book is a life the dragon has observed.
    *   The memory they seek is locked in a special vault. To open it, they must solve a mnemonic puzzle: find three specific books containing memories that rhyme, and place them in the correct order.
    *   The library is patrolled by Mnemonic Sentinels, constructs of pure thought that attack any mind that is not the dragon's own.
**Escalation:** The dragon's consciousness begins to notice the intrusion. The library's orderly shelves begin to twist and warp, becoming a chaotic maze as the dragon's subconscious tries to eject the party.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Curator** — *The Spymaster*
    *   **Role:** The party's employer, an enigmatic figure who organizes the heist. They communicate through magically disguised agents.
    *   **Personality:** Professional, secretive, and utterly pragmatic. They see the heist as a complex intellectual problem and the party as the specialized tools required to solve it.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Curator is the last surviving member of the order that forged the Sun-Swords. The mission is not just about saving the world, but about reclaiming their personal, stolen legacy.

2.  **The Echo of the Forge-Master** — *The Guide*
    *   **Role:** A psychic remnant of the dwarf whose memory of forging the Sun-Swords was consumed by Xylos. It exists as a friendly but fragmented guide within the mindscape.
    *   **Personality:** Gruff, focused, and fading. It has a one-track mind: helping the party find its memory. Its form flickers and distorts, and its sentences are often incomplete.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** It is a fading memory. The longer the party takes, the more it degrades, and its guidance becomes more cryptic and unreliable. If it fades completely, the party will be lost.

3.  **The Id-Beast** — *The Guardian*
    *   **Role:** The psychic manifestation of the dragon's own ego and territorial instinct. It is the final guardian of the lost memory.
    *   **Personality:** It takes the form of a perfect, idealized version of Xylos, made of pure mental energy. It is arrogant, powerful, and sees the players as insignificant parasites in its mind.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** As a being of pure ego, it is vulnerable to attacks that target its pride. Succeeding on an Insight check can reveal a psychic "flaw"—an insecurity the party can exploit to gain an advantage in the fight.

## Key Locations

1.  **The City of Last-Hope:** A besieged fortress-city, the last bastion against the Blighted Lords.
2.  **Xylos's Lair:** A dormant volcano, the physical location of the sleeping dragon.
3.  **The Dragon's Mindscape:** The primary dungeon. A surreal, ever-changing landscape made of memory, including:
    *   **The Sea of Regret:** A stormy ocean of the dragon's guilt.
    *   **The Forest of Faded Names:** A forest where every tree is a creature the dragon has forgotten.
    *   **The Archive of Consumed Lore:** The deep-storage library of the dragon's most precious consumed memories.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a high-concept heist that challenges what a dungeon can be. The central conflict is a battle of wits and wills against a being of immense intellectual power. The players must navigate a world where the rules of physics don't apply and the greatest weapon is a well-remembered fact. It is a story about the nature of memory, identity, and the power of a single, crucial idea.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Psychic Integrity (PI)**
*   While in the mindscape, characters use their **Psychic Integrity (PI)** instead of Hit Points. Your PI maximum is equal to your HP maximum.
*   All damage taken from psychic defenses or personified emotions is dealt to PI. Healing spells and potions do not work; PI is restored by using skills like Persuasion to calm a "Rage-Echo," or by finding a "Tranquil Memory," a safe zone in the mindscape.
*   If a character's PI drops to 0, they are not killed. Their consciousness is violently ejected from the mindscape, and they awaken in the real world. They cannot re-enter the ritual for 24 hours, leaving their companions to fend for themselves.

### 2. **Mnemonic Puzzles**
*   The mindscape is a dungeon of information, not just corridors. Progress is often blocked by **Mnemonic Puzzles** that require the players to interact with the dragon's memories.
*   *Example: To cross a chasm, the players must repair a "broken memory" of a bridge. To do this, they must explore the surrounding area to find the missing pieces of the memory (e.g., "the color of the sunset that day," "the name of the dwarf who built it") and slot them into place.*
*   Solving these puzzles requires investigation and deduction, not just brute force, making the entire dungeon an interactive puzzle.
