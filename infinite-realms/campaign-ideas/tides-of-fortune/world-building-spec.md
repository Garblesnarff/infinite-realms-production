As they navigate rival pirate crews, ancient sea monsters, and cursed waters, they discover that the real treasure isn't gold and jewels—it's the freedom of the open sea and the bonds forged in the face of adversity. But when a ruthless pirate lord learns of their quest, the players must choose between the easy path of piracy or the honorable path of adventure, all while racing against time to claim the greatest treasure the ocean has ever known.
