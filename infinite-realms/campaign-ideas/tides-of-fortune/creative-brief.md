## Voice

A rich, rolling voice with the dramatic flair of a storyteller spinning yarns around a tavern fire. The narrator's standard American accent carries a subtle sea-dog rhythm, with expressive pacing that builds excitement through pregnant pauses and enthusiastic emphasis. The emotion is one of romantic adventure and salty wisdom, as if sharing tales of the sea that have been passed down through generations of sailors. Audio quality features nautical environmental ambience - crashing waves, creaking timbers, wind in the rigging, the distant cry of seabirds, the occasional magical chime from enchanted waters. Role: The voice of a ship's bard, or the legendary Pirate King himself sharing his final testament.
