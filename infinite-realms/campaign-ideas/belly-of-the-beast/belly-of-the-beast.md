## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Belly of the Beast
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Survival Horror / Dungeon Crawl / "Fantastic Voyage"
**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 5–6 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **9–10**
**Tone (keywords):** bizarre, grotesque, claustrophobic, urgent, survival-horror
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
During a climactic battle with a colossal, world-walking giant, the players are defeated in the most humiliating way possible: they are swallowed whole. Awakening in the creature's cavernous stomach, they find themselves in a living, breathing dungeon filled with acidic seas, parasitic ecosystems, and the half-digested ruins of past meals. They must navigate this grotesque internal landscape, traveling up through the giant's body to find an exit before its digestive processes turn them into primordial ooze.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 5–6 sessions)

A desperate dungeon crawl through a living creature.

*   **Act I — The Stomach Sea (Sessions 1–2):** The party awakens in the giant's stomach, a vast cavern filled with a sea of digestive acid. They must use the floating wreckage of a swallowed ship to cross to the relative safety of the esophageal passage, battling stomach parasites and avoiding acid geysers.
*   **Act II — The Living Labyrinth (Sessions 3–4):** The party ascends through the giant's torso. They must navigate the windy, branching tunnels of the lungs, climb the pulsating walls of the throat, and survive the crushing pressure near the giant's heart, all while contending with the creature's immune system.
*   **Act III — The Great Escape (Session 5–6):** The party reaches the giant's head. They must make a choice for their escape route: a disgusting but direct exit through the mouth, a deafening journey through the ear canal, or a risky attempt to blind the giant by attacking its optic nerves from the inside.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Rude Awakening”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Environmental Hazard
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The campaign begins *in media res* as the party awakens, covered in slime, on the shore of an acid sea inside the giant's stomach.
    *   They must survive the initial shock and the environment, realizing where they are.
    *   They find the wreckage of a small cog, half-submerged in the acid, and must fight off a swarm of "Stomach Leeches" to claim it as a raft.
**Escalation:** The giant eats a large meal. A torrent of half-chewed beasts and rocks cascades from the esophagus, creating a tidal wave of acid and new hazards.

### Sessions 2-3 — “The Lung Caverns”
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Unique Terrain
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party travels up the esophagus and enters the giant's lungs, a pair of massive, spongy caverns.
    *   They must navigate the branching, slippery bronchial tubes, timing their movements with the giant's breathing to avoid being blown away by hurricane-force winds.
    *   They encounter a tribe of goblins who were swallowed long ago and now worship the giant as their god.
**Escalation:** The giant catches a cold. The party is caught in a massive, body-wracking cough that threatens to shatter the platforms they are on and send them plummeting back into the stomach.

### Sessions 4-5 — “The Heartbeat Drum”
*   **Focus:** Stealth / Skill Challenge
*   **Key Events:**
    *   To proceed to the head, the party must pass close to the giant's heart, a house-sized muscle whose rhythmic beats send powerful shockwaves through the area.
    *   The area is patrolled by the giant's immune system: large, ooze-like "Phagocyte" creatures that hunt foreign bodies.
    *   The party must time their movements with the deafening heartbeats to avoid attracting the Phagocytes' attention.
**Escalation:** The giant gets agitated. Its heart rate doubles, making the timing puzzle twice as fast and the shockwaves more frequent.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Grizzle, the Lung-Priest** — *The Mad Prophet*
    *   **Role:** The shaman-leader of a tribe of goblins who have made a home in the giant's lungs.
    *   **Personality:** Manic, zealous, and utterly insane. He sees the giant's bodily functions as divine miracles and preaches that being digested is the path to enlightenment.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He knows of a "safe passage" to the giant's head but will only reveal it to those who prove their faith by surviving a dangerous ritual (e.g., inhaling a cloud of "holy" lung-spores).

2.  **Sir Kaelan, Knight of the Gizzard** — *The Hopeless Guardian*
    *   **Role:** A stoic knight, the last survivor of a platoon that was swallowed. He has established a small, fortified camp in a relatively stable part of the digestive tract.
    *   **Personality:** Grim, honor-bound, and filled with despair. He has given up on escaping and now sees his duty as protecting other survivors for as long as possible.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He protects a small community of other survivors (gnomes, dwarves, etc.). He will not abandon them, and any escape plan must include them, complicating matters significantly.

3.  **The Bile-Worm Queen** — *The Parasite Lord*
    *   **Role:** The intelligent, sentient ruler of the giant's parasitic ecosystem.
    *   **Personality:** Alien, imperious, and territorial. It communicates telepathically and sees the party as either a threat or a potential meal. It is not evil, merely predatory.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Queen is ancient and has absorbed the memories of some of those it has consumed. It can offer valuable information about the giant's anatomy or weaknesses, but its price is always a tribute of living flesh.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Stomach Sea:** A churning, acidic ocean dotted with islands of half-digested rock and bone.
2.  **The Bronchial Maze:** The spongy, branching tunnels of the giant's lungs, filled with powerful winds and strange flora.
3.  **The Heart-Forge:** The area around the giant's heart, where the constant, percussive beat makes stealth impossible and the air thrums with power.
4.  **The Cranial Cathedral:** The vast, echoing chamber of the giant's skull, containing its brain—a shimmering, lightning-filled orb of pure thought.

## Central Conflict

This is a bizarre and desperate race against a biological clock. The central conflict is a pure survival-horror dungeon crawl where the dungeon itself is the main antagonist. It tests the party's ability to adapt to a completely alien environment, overcome grotesque challenges, and keep their sanity in a world that is actively trying to dissolve them.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Bodily Hazards**
*   The dungeon is a living body, and its functions are deadly. At the start of each round in a hazardous area, the DM can roll on a **Giant's Action** table.
*   *Examples: "The giant sneezes (a blast of air and blinding mucus issues from the nasal passages)." "The giant drinks (a tidal wave of cold water floods the stomach)." "A stomach cramp occurs (all fleshy surfaces constrict, potentially crushing those in tight passages)."
*   This makes the environment an active, unpredictable threat.

### 2. **Parasitic Symbiosis**
*   Players can harvest organs and components from the parasites they defeat. During a short rest, a player can make a Medicine or Nature check to integrate a component into their gear, creating a temporary or permanent symbiotic item.
*   *Examples: Attaching the gland of a "Glow-Maggot" to a shield to make it function like a torch. Weaving the hide of a "Stomach Fluke" into a cloak to gain resistance to acid damage. Using the nerve-cluster of a "Synaptic Leech" as a one-time-use item to cast *Detect Thoughts*.
