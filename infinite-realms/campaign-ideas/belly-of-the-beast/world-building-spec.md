### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**Belly of the Beast**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** During a climactic battle with a colossal, world-walking giant, the players are defeated in the most humiliating way possible: they are swallowed whole. Awakening in the creature's cavernous stomach, they find themselves in a living, breathing dungeon filled with acidic seas, parasitic ecosystems, and the half-digested ruins of past meals. They must navigate this grotesque internal landscape, traveling up through the giant's body to find an exit before its digestive processes turn them into primordial ooze.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the legend of the World-Walking Giant: its origins, its path of destruction, and past attempts to defeat it.
    *   Write the history of the goblin tribe in the lungs. How did they get there? How has their culture adapted to life inside a god-beast?
    *   Describe the biology of the giant's internal ecosystem, including the parasites and the immune system creatures.
    *   Detail the story of Sir Kaelan and his doomed platoon. What were they trying to achieve before they were swallowed?

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Lung-Goblins** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To appease their god (the giant) and live in harmony with its bodily functions.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the shaman-leader, Grizzle the Lung-Priest.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To survive and worship.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To capture outsiders and offer them as sacrifices to the "Great Digestion."
        *   **Assets:** A small, hidden village in the lung caverns, knowledge of safe passages, crude weapons made of bone and sinew.
        *   **Relationships:** Hostile to all outsiders; view the Bile-Worms as unclean spirits.
    *   **The Survivors of Fort Gizzard** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To survive and protect the weak.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the grim knight, Sir Kaelan.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To create a safe haven for anyone swallowed by the giant.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Sir Kaelan secretly hopes to find a way to kill the giant from the inside, even if it means sacrificing himself and his followers.
        *   **Assets:** A small, fortified camp; a handful of trained soldiers; a dwindling supply of salvaged gear.
        *   **Relationships:** Deeply suspicious of the Lung-Goblins; terrified of the Bile-Worm Queen.
    *   **The Bile-Worm Brood** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To consume all organic matter within the giant and protect their territory.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Ruled by the telepathic Bile-Worm Queen.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To feed and multiply.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Queen seeks to absorb enough psychic energy from consumed creatures to achieve a higher state of consciousness and escape the giant's body.
        *   **Assets:** A massive network of tunnels throughout the digestive tract, swarms of lesser worms, telepathic communication.
        *   **Relationships:** Views all other inhabitants as food or tools.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Grizzle, the Lung-Priest:** A manic and zealous goblin shaman who worships the giant's bodily functions.
    *   **Sir Kaelan, Knight of the Gizzard:** A stoic and hopeless knight who has given up on escape and now protects other survivors.
    *   **The Bile-Worm Queen:** An ancient, intelligent, and telepathic parasite lord that rules the giant's digestive tract.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Fanatical Goblin Follower"
    *   "Despairing Survivor"
    *   "Mindless Stomach Leech (Creature)"
    *   "Ooze-like Phagocyte (Creature)"
    *   "Skittish Gnome Tinkerer (Survivor)"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Stomach Sea:** A churning, acidic ocean dotted with islands of half-digested rock and bone.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Wreck of the *Sea-Drake*, the Esophageal Arch, Geysers of Reflux, the Shore of Bones.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Stomach Leeches, Acid-Resistant Barnacles, the party upon arrival.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Salvageable wreckage, indigestible minerals.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** An acid geyser erupts, a half-digested monster's corpse floats by, a wave of acid washes over the shore, the giant's stomach contracts violently, a swarm of Stomach Leeches attacks.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The ship's log of the *Sea-Drake* might have a map of the upper tracts." "There's a knight who survived and made a fort somewhere above the stomach." "The goblins in the lungs trade passage for tribute."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Greenish acid, floating debris, fleshy walls), Sound (Gurgling, bubbling, the distant roar of digestion), Smell (Acrid, sour, rotting).
    *   **The Lung Caverns:** A pair of massive, spongy caverns with branching, slippery bronchial tubes.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Goblin Village of Phlegm, the Great Bronchial Divide, the Alveolar Sacs, a field of strange, air-filtering fungi.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The Lung-Goblin tribe, spore-releasing fungi, air elementals (sneezes).
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Trade with the goblins (at a price), safe (but disgusting) shelter.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A sudden, hurricane-force inhale/exhale, a patrol of goblin hunters, a patch of hallucinogenic fungi, a body-wracking cough causes a cave-in, an encounter with another group of survivors.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Lung-Priest knows a secret way to the throat." "The goblins fear the 'rumbling god' in the chest." "A strange knight lives in the gizzard, they say he's mad."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Spongy walls, mist, goblin huts made of cartilage), Sound (Constant wind, goblin chants, wet squelching), Smell (Damp, musty, strange spores).
    *   **The Cranial Cathedral:** The vast, echoing chamber of the giant's skull, containing its brain—a shimmering, lightning-filled orb of pure thought.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Orb of Thought (the brain), the Optic Nerve Tunnels, the Auditory Canals, the base of the spine.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Synaptic Leeches, Memory-Phantoms (psychic echoes), the giant's consciousness (as an environmental force).
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This is the final boss area.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A sudden, painful memory from the giant flashes through the party's minds, a patrol of advanced Phagocytes, the giant thinks, causing a psychic storm, a Synaptic Leech attempts to drain a player's intelligence, the floor of the skull shifts as the giant turns its head.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "Attacking the Orb of Thought might be the only way out." "The optic nerves lead to the eyes - a clear, if dangerous, exit." "The ear canals are loud, but lead directly outside."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Pulsating brain, flashing synapses, ghostly images), Sound (Low hum of thought, crackle of psychic energy, the party's own echoing footsteps), Smell (Ozone, electricity, nothingness).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players fail to avoid the acid wave in the stomach after the giant eats.
    *   **THEN:** They are washed into a more dangerous, previously inaccessible part of the stomach. Generate a new mini-dungeon based on what the giant just ate (e.g., a half-digested wizard's tower).
    *   **IF:** The players kill Grizzle the Lung-Priest.
    *   **THEN:** The goblin tribe becomes fractured and chaotic. Some may become allies, others may become even more hostile, launching disorganized attacks throughout the lung caverns.
    *   **IF:** The players agree to help Sir Kaelan and his community of survivors.
    *   **THEN:** All future escape plans must account for a larger group of non-combatants, adding a new layer of complexity and escort-style objectives to challenges.
    *   **IF:** The players make a deal with the Bile-Worm Queen, offering it a tribute.
    *   **THEN:** The Queen grants them safe passage through its territory and provides a crucial piece of information about the giant's anatomy. However, it now demands another, more difficult tribute.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to exit through the giant's eye sockets.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a final encounter where the party must fight the giant's eye-mites on the surface of its cornea while it is awake and looking around, before making a perilous leap to safety.
