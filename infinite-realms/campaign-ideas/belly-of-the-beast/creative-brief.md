# Creative Brief: Belly of the Beast

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Biomechanical Body Horror (Scorn-inspired)

Inspired by the visceral, grotesque, and deeply unsettling biomechanical aesthetic of the video game *Scorn*. This style aims to capture the bizarre, claustrophobic, and urgent survival horror of being trapped within a colossal living creature, where the environment itself is a pulsating, organic dungeon.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Visceral Organics:** Describe environments and creatures as if they are composed of flesh, bone, sinew, and internal organs. Focus on textures like wetness, sliminess, and pulsation.
*   **Claustrophobia and Confinement:** Convey the sense of being trapped within a living, breathing space. Use tight compositions and emphasize narrow passages and oppressive ceilings.
*   **Grotesque Detail:** Do not shy away from disturbing or unsettling details. The horror comes from the raw, biological reality of the setting.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Bizarre, grotesque, claustrophobic, visceral, organic, unsettling, survival-horror, fleshy, pulsating, nightmarish.
*   **Feeling:** A constant sense of dread, disgust, and urgency. The atmosphere should be oppressive and disorienting, with the environment actively trying to consume the characters. A profound sense of being out of place and vulnerable.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Highly realistic and detailed, with a focus on conveying the textures and forms of biological matter. Lines are often fluid and organic, but can be sharp and jagged for bone or teeth-like structures.
*   **Forms:** Environments are shaped by internal anatomy (rib cages as arches, intestines as tunnels, organs as platforms). Creatures are often amorphous, parasitic, or have distorted, unsettling biological forms.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Scorn. The focus is on the wet, glistening surface of a pulsating, fleshy tunnel, with visible veins and sinews."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by muted, sickly, and earthy tones: various shades of fleshy pinks, deep reds (blood, muscle), purples (veins, decay), and greens (bile, internal fluids). 
*   **Accents:** Occasional bioluminescent glows from internal organs, parasitic life, or strange fungi, often in sickly yellows or greens, providing eerie illumination.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of fleshy pinks and deep purples, with a sickly green bioluminescent glow emanating from the walls of the cavern."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Human characters are realistically proportioned, but often appear covered in slime, grime, or the detritus of the giant's interior. Their gear might be corroded or stained.
*   **Creatures (Parasites/Immune System):** These are the primary inhabitants. Designs should be grotesque and unsettling, often resembling mutated insects, leeches, or amorphous blobs of flesh. They should feel like natural, yet horrifying, extensions of the giant's biology.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A human adventurer, covered in glistening slime, navigates a narrow passage made of pulsating, wet flesh. In the foreground, a grotesque, multi-limbed parasite with sharp, chitinous claws emerges from a fold in the wall."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The giant's interior is a vast, living dungeon. Environments are composed of biological structures: cavernous stomachs with acidic seas, spongy lung chambers with bronchial tubes, pulsating heart chambers, and brain-like cranial cathedrals.
*   **Atmosphere:** Humid, hot, and filled with the sounds of squelching, gurgling, and the giant's internal processes. The air might be thick with spores or acidic mist.
*   **Details:** Half-digested wreckage of past meals, strange internal flora, pools of digestive fluids, visible veins and arteries, and the constant, unsettling movement of living tissue.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of the giant's stomach, a vast, cavernous space filled with a churning, acidic sea. Islands of half-digested bone and rock float on the surface, and massive, fleshy stalactites hang from the ceiling."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Often dim, indirect, and atmospheric. Light sources are scarce, coming from bioluminescent organisms, faint glows from internal organs, or the characters' own limited light sources.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, oppressive shadows that obscure details and enhance the claustrophobia. Shadows often have a wet, glistening quality.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of dread, mystery, and to highlight the grotesque details of the environment. It emphasizes the characters' vulnerability.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dimly lit by the faint, sickly green bioluminescence of parasitic fungi on the walls, casting long, distorted shadows of the characters on the wet, fleshy ground. The lighting emphasizes the claustrophobic and grotesque atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses tight, claustrophobic compositions to emphasize confinement. Can also use wide shots to convey the bizarre scale of the internal organs as environments.
*   **Techniques:** Employ forced perspective to make tunnels seem endless or organs seem impossibly vast. Frame characters within narrow passages or against the backdrop of pulsating walls. Use leading lines (e.g., veins, sinews) to guide the eye through the organic landscape.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A tight, over-the-shoulder shot of a character crawling through a narrow, wet tunnel made of pulsating flesh. The composition emphasizes the claustrophobia and the visceral nature of the environment."

## Voice

A wet, gurgling, whispery, gender-neutral voice, like the internal processes of a colossal, decaying organism. The pacing is slow and deliberate, punctuated by unsettling, squelching pauses, as if the very air is thick with dread. The emotion is a pervasive, suffocating darkness, a primal, biological horror that seeps into every syllable. Audio quality is close-miked, with a visceral, organic wetness and a deep, echoing reverb that suggests vast, pulsating internal chambers. Role: The ambient, malevolent consciousness of the beast itself, or the chilling whisper of its digestive processes.
