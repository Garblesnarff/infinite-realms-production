# The God-Corpse Isles

*An Exploration / Nautical campaign — Long Campaign (15-20 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The God-Corpse Isles
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Nautical Exploration / Body Horror / Mythic Fantasy
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **13–14**
**Tone (keywords):** grotesque, wondrous, epic, nautical, decaying
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The world is a vast ocean, dotted with islands formed from the colossal, slowly decaying corpse of a dead god. The god's flesh has become land, its bones have become mountains, and its blood has become a source of potent, corrupting magic known as 'Ichor.' The players are a ship's crew who, after surviving a storm, find themselves drawn into a race to the god's heart. They must get there before a death cult can perform a ritual to resurrect the dead god, an act that would not save the world, but consume it in a tidal wave of divine, necrotic flesh.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15-20 sessions)

A three-act arc of exploration, corruption, and deicide.

*   **Act I — The Outer Flesh (Sessions 1–6):** The party explores the more 'stable' islands on the god's outer limbs. They learn about the nature of the world, the power of Ichor, and the existence of the "Carrion Callers," the death cult seeking to resurrect the god.
*   **Act II — The Visceral Sea (Sessions 7–13):** The party must navigate the dangerous inner sea, a region of churning Ichor and half-living organs. They will face mutated monsters, rival Ichor-hunters, and the increasingly powerful Carrion Callers as they journey deeper into the god's body.
*   **Act III — The Heart of the Matter (Sessions 14–20):** The party reaches the God-Corpse's chest cavity, a continent-sized cavern containing the still-beating, crystalline heart. They must fight their way through the cult's stronghold and stop the resurrection ritual before the final beat.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Crimson Wake”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Exploration
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party's ship is wrecked on a strange island with soil like hardened flesh and rivers of black, viscous Ichor.
    *   They discover the island is a fragment of a much larger, biological landmass.
    *   They salvage a small, Ichor-powered vessel from other castaways.
**Escalation:** A "Corpse-Tide" washes in, bringing with it grotesque, half-formed creatures born from the god's decaying dreams.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Boneyard Archipelago”
*   **Focus:** Nautical Travel / Faction Politics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party navigates a chain of islands formed by the god's skeletal hand.
    *   They encounter the two main factions: the "Marrow-Miners" who harvest the god's bones for building materials, and the "Vein-Tappers" who trade in raw Ichor.
    *   They learn the Carrion Callers are buying up vast quantities of Ichor for a dark purpose.

    *   They find a dying member of the Carrion Callers, who reveals the cult's plan to restart the god's heart.
**Escalation:** The entire island begins to spasm, a final, agonal breath that threatens to crush everything on its surface.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The First Vulture** — *The Cult Leader*
    *   **Role:** The charismatic and fanatical leader of the Carrion Callers.
    *   **Personality:** Serene, messianic, and utterly convinced that the god's resurrection will bring about a paradise of flesh.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is not a true believer, but a nihilist who knows the resurrection will destroy the world. He is a former scholar who went mad after gazing into the god's dead eyes.

2.  **Captain 'Marrow' Malthus** — *The Pragmatic Pirate*
    *   **Role:** A powerful pirate lord who controls the trade of the god's resources. He can be a powerful ally or a ruthless enemy.
    *   **Personality:** Booming, greedy, but with a strange sense of honor. He respects strength and despises weakness.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His body is riddled with Ichor-corruption, which he keeps hidden beneath heavy coats. He is desperately searching for a cure.

3.  **The Norn of the Optic Nerve** — *The Oracle*
    *   **Role:** A trio of blind hags who live within the god's petrified eye socket. They can offer cryptic guidance to the party.
    *   **Personality:** They speak in unison, their voices like cracking bone. They are ancient, cruel, and amused by the struggles of lesser beings.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** They do not see the future, but rather the past. They are reading the god's final, fading memories, which can be unreliable or misinterpreted.

## Key Locations

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of faith, decay, and the consequences of ambition. It is a journey into a world that is both a graveyard and a cradle of new, monstrous life. The central conflict forces the party to confront the legacy of a dead power and decide if some things are better left buried.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Ichor Corruption**
*   Ichor can be used as a potent, but dangerous, resource. It can fuel ships, create magic items, or even be consumed for a temporary boost (acting like a powerful potion).
*   However, any use of Ichor forces a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the character gains a level of **Ichor Corruption**.
*   Each level of corruption comes with a grotesque physical mutation, determined by a random table. These mutations can be both a blessing and a curse (e.g., *Your skin becomes a hard, chitinous plate, granting +1 AC, but you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks*).
*   At 5 levels of corruption, a character becomes a monstrous NPC under the DM's control.

### 2. **The Living World**
*   The world itself is a decaying body, and the DM can introduce sudden, unexpected environmental events. A sudden muscle spasm could cause an earthquake, a buildup of gasses could lead to a toxic eruption, or a nerve cluster could fire, creating a localized lightning storm.
