**Estimated Length:** Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions (each session ≈ 3–4 hours)
**Player Level Range:** Start **9** → Finish **13–14**
**Tone (keywords):** surreal, mind-bending, paranoid, stylish, high-concept
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The party is a team of dream-walkers, elite psychic operatives who can enter the minds of others. They are hired by a mysterious corporation to perform a feat of corporate espionage known as "inception": to plant an idea in the mind of a rival CEO. They must navigate the surreal and dangerous landscape of the CEO's subconscious, a world shaped by his memories, fears, and desires, all while being hunted by his psychic projections and the ever-present threat of losing their own minds in the dreamscape.

## What “Hard” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The dreamscape is a world of pure thought, and the enemies are not made of flesh and blood, but of memory and emotion. The party will face off against the CEO's psychic projections, which can take the form of anything from his childhood fears to his corporate rivals. Combat is as much a battle of wits as it is a battle of strength.
*   **The Dreamscape:** The dreamscape is an unstable and unpredictable environment. The laws of physics are constantly in flux, and the party's own thoughts and emotions can have a direct and often dangerous effect on the world around them.
*   **Consequences:** The greatest danger in the dreamscape is not death, but the loss of self. If a character's mind is broken in the dream, they can be trapped in a coma forever. The party must not only protect their minds from the dangers of the dreamscape, but also from the temptations of their own subconscious.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 6–8 sessions)

A three-act arc that takes the party deeper and deeper into the layers of the subconscious.

*   **Act I — The Mark (Sessions 1–2):** The party is hired and given their target: the CEO of a rival corporation. They must research their mark, learning his history, his personality, and his psychological weaknesses.
*   **Act II — The Dream (Sessions 3–5):** The party enters the CEO's dream. They must travel through the different layers of his subconscious, from his recent memories to his childhood fears, to plant the idea.
*   **Act III — The Extraction (Sessions 6–8):** The idea is planted, but the CEO's subconscious is now on high alert. The party must escape the dreamscape before they are trapped forever, a task that is made more difficult by the fact that the dream is collapsing around them.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a battle for the mind. It is a story about the nature of reality, the power of ideas, and the question of whether it is right to manipulate the thoughts and desires of others, even for a good cause. The party must not only pull off an impossible heist, but also confront the darkest corners of their own minds.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Dream Layers**

*   The dreamscape is divided into multiple layers, each with its own unique rules and environment. The deeper the party goes, the more surreal and dangerous the dream becomes.

### 2. **The Projections**

*   The dreamscape is populated by projections of the mark's subconscious. These projections can be friendly or hostile, and they can take any form, from ordinary people to monstrous creatures.

### 3. **The Kick**

*   The only way to escape the dream is with a "kick," a synchronized event that will wake up all the dreamers at the same time. The party must carefully plan their kicks, as a failed kick can leave them trapped in the dream forever.
