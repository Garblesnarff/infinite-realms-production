## What “Light” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The focus of the campaign is on healing and problem-solving, not combat. While the party may have to deal with the occasional scared or angry creature, most conflicts can be resolved through compassion, ingenuity, and a good bedside manner.
*   **Medical Mysteries:** Each session will present the party with a new medical mystery. They will need to use their knowledge of magical creatures, their diagnostic skills, and their creativity to figure out what is wrong with their patients and how to treat them.
*   **Consequences:** The stakes are personal, not epic. The life of a single creature may be in the balance, but the fate of the world is not. The goal is to tell heartwarming and engaging stories about the bond between people and their pets, no matter how strange those pets may be.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Medical Mysteries**

*   Each session will feature a new medical mystery. The DM will present the party with a patient and a set of symptoms, and the party will have to use their skills and knowledge to diagnose the problem and find a cure. This can be run as a series of skill challenges, with the party making checks in skills like Medicine, Nature, and Arcana.

### 2. **Patient Care**

*   The party will be responsible for the day-to-day care of their patients. This can include everything from feeding and cleaning to providing emotional support. The DM can create a simple system for tracking the health and morale of the patients, which can be affected by the party's actions.

### 3. **Reputation with Species**

*   As the party successfully treats different types of creatures, they will gain a reputation with that species. This can have a variety of effects, from making it easier to treat other members of that species to being able to call on them for help in a time of need.
