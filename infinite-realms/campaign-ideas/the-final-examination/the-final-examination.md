This campaign explores the horror of institutional predation, the paranoia of hidden knowledge, and the desperation of escape. The central conflict revolves around the university's vampiric faculty who cultivate students like crops for their magical life force.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Suspicion & Dread System**
*   Players track "Suspicion" and "Dread" meters that increase through risky actions and horrifying discoveries.
*   High Suspicion makes academic and social challenges harder, while high Dread causes psychological effects.
*   Players must escape before either meter reaches maximum, or face capture or psychological breakdown.

### 2. **Academic Preparation System**
*   Attending classes provides crucial skills and resources for the escape plan.
*   Each class offers "Boons" - information, items, or abilities that help with specific escape challenges.
*   The system forces players to balance the risk of raising suspicion against the need for preparation.

### 3. **The Social Web**
*   Players build relationships with other students, faculty, and staff.
*   The web provides resources and information but creates vulnerabilities if discovered.
*   Social connections can be leveraged for escape plans but may require difficult moral choices.
