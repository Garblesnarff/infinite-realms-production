# Creative Brief: Saga of the Stone-Born

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Mythic Realism (God of War 2018-inspired)

Inspired by the brutal, beautiful, and mythic realism of *God of War* (2018) and its Norse mythological setting. This style aims to capture the harsh, primeval, and survivalist tone of the "Saga of the Stone-Born," where early humanoids battle for survival against a relentless ice age and discover nascent, elemental powers.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Harshness and Resilience:** Depict the brutal reality of the ice age and the strength and determination of the characters.
*   **Integrate Mythic Elements Subtly:** Magic and ancient forces should feel like an organic, powerful part of the natural world, not overtly flashy.
*   **Focus on Texture and Detail:** Convey the cold, rough textures of ice, rock, fur, and primitive tools.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Brutal, primeval, mythic, survivalist, harsh, cold, elemental, raw, epic.
*   **Feeling:** A constant struggle against an unforgiving environment. A sense of ancient power stirring beneath the ice. The atmosphere should be one of grim determination, with moments of awe at the raw beauty and power of the world.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and highly detailed, with a focus on conveying the ruggedness of the environment and the strength of the characters. Lines are sharp and defined for ice and rock, and more organic for fur and flesh.
*   **Forms:** Characters are depicted with powerful, grounded forms. Megafauna are massive and imposing. Landscapes are vast and sculpted by ice and wind.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of God of War (2018). The focus is on the rugged, snow-covered face of a Stone-Born hunter, his eyes narrowed against the biting wind."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by cold, muted tones: various shades of blue, white, gray, and deep, desaturated greens for ice, snow, and frozen landscapes. Warm accents come from fire, animal furs, and the subtle glow of nascent magic.
*   **Elemental Glows:** Nascent magical abilities should manifest as subtle, elemental glows (e.g., a faint blue for ice magic, a soft orange for fire, a shimmering purple for psionics).
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a cold, muted color palette of icy blues and stark whites, with a warm, flickering orange glow from a campfire, and a subtle, ethereal blue light emanating from a character's hand."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Early humanoids are depicted with powerful, resilient builds, emphasizing their physical strength and adaptation to the harsh environment. They are clad in thick furs, hides, and primitive armor made from bone and stone.
*   **Expression:** Faces are often grim, determined, or show the strain of survival. Eyes are sharp and watchful.
*   **Megafauna:** Woolly mammoths, sabertooth tigers, and other prehistoric beasts are rendered with realistic detail, conveying their immense power and wild nature.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Stone-Born warrior, clad in thick mammoth furs and wielding a bone-tipped spear, stands defiantly against a raging blizzard. His face is etched with determination, and his breath mists in the freezing air."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast, unforgiving frozen landscapes: towering glaciers, deep crevasses, ice caves, and snow-covered forests. The environment is a constant threat and a source of both beauty and danger.
*   **Atmosphere:** Biting winds, swirling snow, and the eerie silence of the frozen wilderness. The sky is often overcast and grey, or filled with the dramatic light of aurora borealis.
*   **Details:** Ancient ice formations, frozen waterfalls, the skeletal remains of long-dead creatures, and the occasional glimpse of ancient cave paintings or monolithic ice structures.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of a vast, frozen tundra under a grey, overcast sky. Towering glaciers loom in the distance, and a biting wind whips snow across the desolate landscape. A herd of woolly mammoths trudges through the deep snow."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, cold, and often dramatic lighting. Sunlight is weak and diffused by snow and clouds, creating a stark, almost monochromatic feel. Firelight provides warm, flickering contrast.
*   **Shadows:** Long, sharp shadows cast by ice formations and figures, emphasizing the cold and the vastness. Shadows can be deep and blue-tinged.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to convey the brutal cold, the struggle for survival, and the emerging power of magic. It highlights the stark beauty of the frozen world.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the weak, diffused light of a sun struggling through heavy clouds, casting long, blue-tinged shadows across the snow. The scene is cold and stark, emphasizing the harshness of the environment."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, expansive shots to emphasize the vastness of the frozen landscape and the smallness of the characters within it. Can also use tight, action-oriented shots for intense encounters with megafauna.
*   **Techniques:** Employ leading lines (e.g., tracks in the snow, ice ridges) to guide the eye. Frame characters against towering glaciers or vast, empty plains. Use low angles to make megafauna appear more imposing, or high angles to emphasize vulnerability.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a small group of Stone-Born hunters, dwarfed by a colossal, ancient glacier. The composition emphasizes their isolation and the overwhelming scale of the frozen world."

## Voice

An old, deep, and resonant male voice, like the grinding of ancient glaciers or the rumble of distant thunder across a frozen tundra. His Nordic-inflected accent is thick with the weight of ages, with a slow and deliberate pacing that emphasizes the harsh, unforgiving nature of the world. The emotion is a profound, stoic endurance, a grim determination born from endless struggle against the elements. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a pervasive, cold echo that suggests vast, empty ice caves and the biting wind of the frozen wastes. Role: The ancient spirit of the ice, or a grizzled elder recounting the sagas of their people.
