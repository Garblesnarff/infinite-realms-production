## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A three-act arc about survival, discovery, and the birth of legends.

*   **Act I — The Great Blizzard (Sessions 1–4):** The party is on a hunt when a supernatural blizzard, the "White Maw," descends. They are separated from their tribe and must use their wits and budding powers to survive the initial onslaught, find shelter, and endure the harsh landscape alone.
*   **Act II — The Trail of the Sun-Stone (Sessions 5–10):** Following cryptic cave paintings and whispers from ancestral spirits, the party embarks on a perilous journey to find the Sun-Stone. They will cross treacherous glaciers, navigate monster-infested valleys, and contend with rival, hostile tribes.
*   **Act III — The Heart of the Glacier (Sessions 11–15):** The party discovers the Sun-Stone is not a stone, but the heart of a dormant primordial entity of fire, trapped within an ancient glacier. They must awaken it to end the ice age, a task that will pit them against the very spirits of winter and the tribe of cannibals who worship the cold.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Kaelen One-Eye** — *The Cannibal Chief*
    *   **Role:** The ruthless and pragmatic leader of the Ice-Ghouls. He sees the endless winter as a cleansing fire that weeds out the weak.

    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He was once a member of the players' tribe, exiled for his dark beliefs, and he secretly wants to consume the players to steal their unique powers.

2.  **Lyra Swift-Spear** — *The Rival Hunter*

3.  **The Ancestor Spirit** — *The Cryptic Guide*

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a primal struggle of person vs. nature, where the world itself is the primary antagonist. It explores themes of survival, community, and the birth of myth, as the players' actions will become the legends for all future generations. The central conflict is whether the Stone-Born will be the saviors of their people or just another casualty of the endless winter.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Resource & Survival System**
*   A simplified system for tracking food, water, and warmth. Each day in the wilderness requires consuming resources.
*   Lack of resources imposes levels of exhaustion. The party must actively hunt, forage, and craft to survive.
*   Crafting is essential: weapons from bone and flint, armor from hides, and shelter from whatever they can find.

### 2. **Nascent Powers**
*   Players start with limited, uncontrolled magical or psionic abilities. Instead of spell slots, they might have a pool of "Energy Dice" (d6s).
*   To use a power, they roll a die. On a 4-6, it works as intended. On a 2-3, it works but has a minor, uncontrolled side effect. On a 1, it fails and triggers a significant, dangerous surge of wild power.
*   As they level up, they gain more dice and more control, eventually transitioning to a more standard magic system.
