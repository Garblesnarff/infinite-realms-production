### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Verdant Codex**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** Based on the real-life Voynich Manuscript, the players find a single page from the legendary Verdant Codex, a reality-bending field guide to the Feywild. They are immediately hunted by two factions: agents of the Archfey who seek to reclaim their sacred text, and a cabal of mortal wizards who wish to exploit its power. The campaign is a race to find the scattered pages of the Codex, decipher its secrets, and decide the fate of its immense power.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of the Verdant Codex. Who wrote it, and why is it written in a forgotten dialect of Sylvan?
    *   Write the story of the mortal archmage who stole the Codex from the Gloomwood Archive and what led to his madness and the scattering of its pages.
    *   Describe the nature of the Feywild in this setting, its chaotic constellations, and its relationship with the Material Plane.
    *   Explain the philosophy of the Archfey's court regarding the Codex and their reasons for wanting it returned.
    *   Detail the history and ambitions of the mortal wizard cabal that seeks the Codex.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.

        *   **Secret Agenda:** To prevent the Codex's secrets from unbalancing the delicate relationship between the Feywild and the Material Plane.
        *   **Assets:** Powerful fey magic, a network of fey spies, the ability to traverse the Feywild.
        *   **Relationships:** Views the players as thieves or grave-robbers, but may be reasoned with. Hostile to the Wizard Cabal.

        *   **Secret Agenda:** To exploit the Codex's reality-bending power for personal gain and political domination.
        *   **Assets:** Powerful mortal magic, a network of spies and hired mercenaries, a willingness to be utterly ruthless.
        *   **Relationships:** Views the players as rivals and the Fey Court as an obstacle to be overcome.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **The Knight of Thorns:** The stoic and relentless Eladrin knight tasked by the Archfey with retrieving the Codex.

*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **An Ancient Ruin (Page Location):** A ruin from a lost civilization where a page of the Codex is hidden.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The puzzle-locked entrance, a chamber with a riddle from a forgotten culture, the pedestal where the page is kept, the ghost of a failed treasure hunter.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Ancient guardians (constructs or undead), opportunistic monsters, ghosts.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This is a dungeon.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A patrol from the Fey Court arrives, a team from the Magus Covenant attacks, a trap is triggered, the party finds the journal of a previous explorer, a wandering monster has swallowed a piece of the page.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The guardians of this ruin were allied with the Fey." "The Magus Covenant has already been here and taken the real page, leaving a fake." "The page's illustration is a map to the next page."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Crumbling stone, dust, faded murals, cobwebs), Sound (An eerie silence, the drip of water, the groan of shifting stone), Smell (Dust, decay, damp earth).
    *   **The Gloomwood Archive (in the Feywild):** The original home of the Verdant Codex, a grand library in the heart of the Feywild.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The empty pedestal where the Codex once sat, the living shelves made of ancient trees, the reading room overlooking a Feywild vista, the Archfey's throne.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The Archfey, Eladrin knights, fey librarians, sentient books.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Access to fey knowledge, an audience with the Archfey.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A book offers the party a riddle, a fey noble challenges a player to a contest of wits, the party is accused of a breach of etiquette, a magical plant from the Codex is growing in the library's garden, the Magus Covenant launches a direct assault on the archive.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Archfey is not angry about the theft, but sad." "The Codex was not just a book; it was the Archfey's heart." "There is a secret copy of the Codex hidden somewhere in the archive."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Towering, living trees; books with glowing covers; shimmering light), Sound (The rustle of leaves, the chime of fey music, whispers in Sylvan), Smell (Flowers, rain, old paper).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully decipher a page of the Verdant Codex.
    *   **THEN:** They learn a new, unique magical ability based on the page's content (e.g., the ability to brew a specific potion, speak with a certain type of plant, or predict a minor future event). This ability is a tangible reward for their progress.
    *   **IF:** The players are captured by the Court of Gloomwood.
    *   **THEN:** They are not killed, but are put on trial in the Feywild. Generate a social combat encounter where the players must defend their actions and win their freedom through wit and clever arguments, according to fey law.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to sell a page of the Codex to the Magus Covenant.
    *   **THEN:** They receive a large sum of gold and a powerful magic item. However, the Covenant uses the page's knowledge to create a new, dangerous magical weapon, which the players must then deal with in a later session.
    *   **IF:** The players use the knowledge from a Codex page to navigate a shortcut through the Feywild.
    *   **THEN:** They arrive at their destination quickly, but their use of the Codex's power leaves a magical trail that allows the Knight of Thorns to track them more easily.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players have collected all the pages and must decide the Codex's fate.
    *   **THEN:** Generate three distinct final encounters based on their choice: 1) **Return it:** A diplomatic mission to the Feywild to return the book, facing final tests of worthiness. 2) **Destroy it:** A dangerous ritual to unmake the artifact, which is attacked by both factions who want the book for themselves. 3) **Keep it:** The players become a new, powerful faction in the world, but are now permanently hunted by all others who covet the Codex's power.
