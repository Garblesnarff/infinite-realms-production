## Voice

An ancient, gender-neutral voice, soft and rustling, like the turning of ancient, brittle pages in a forgotten library. The timbre is clear and ethereal, with a subtle, almost imperceptible, hum that suggests the presence of latent magic. The pacing is slow and deliberate, each word a carefully unfurled secret, conveying the immense weight of forgotten knowledge and the delicate balance of reality. The emotion is a blend of detached wisdom, a subtle, playful mischief, and a deep, underlying sense of ancient secrets waiting to be revealed. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a pervasive, ambient static and the faint, distant sound of shimmering narrative energy. Role: The voice of the Verdant Codex itself, or a sentient page whispering its secrets across time and space.
