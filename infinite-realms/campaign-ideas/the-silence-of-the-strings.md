## What “Light” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The campaign is more about harmony than hostility. The party will face challenges that require them to use their musical talents to solve problems, from soothing a savage beast with a lullaby to inspiring a dispirited army with a battle hymn. Combat will be rare and will often have a musical solution.
*   **Musical Puzzles:** The world of Harmonia is filled with musical puzzles. The party will need to use their knowledge of music theory, their sense of rhythm, and their creativity to solve them.
*   **Consequences:** The stakes are emotional, not physical. The party is not in danger of dying, but they are in danger of losing their hope, their inspiration, and their music. The goal is to tell a story that is as beautiful and moving as a well-composed song.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Musical Magic**

*   In the world of Harmonia, all magic is based on music. Spells are cast by singing, playing an instrument, or through rhythmic dance. The DM can create a system where the effectiveness of a spell is determined by the quality of the player's performance (which can be represented by a Performance skill check).

### 2. **The Great Song**

*   The Great Song is a collaborative creation that the party will write over the course of the campaign. Each time they find a Lost Chord, they will be able to add a new element to the song (e.g., a melody, a harmony, a rhythm). The final song will be a reflection of the party's journey and their own unique talents.

### 3. **The Power of Harmony**

*   When the party plays music together, they can create powerful magical effects. The DM can create a system where the party can combine their musical abilities to create harmonies that can soothe savage beasts, inspire armies, or even reshape the world around them.
