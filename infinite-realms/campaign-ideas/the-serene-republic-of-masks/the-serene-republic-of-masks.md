They are tasked with uncovering a shadowy conspiracy aiming to use the festival's cover to assassinate the city's leader, the Doge, and seize power.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 10-12 sessions)

A cold war of secrets fought during a city-wide festival.

*   **Act I — The First Thread (Sessions 1–3):** The party uncovers the first hint of the plot during the festival's opening ceremony. They must create their first personas and masks to investigate the city's powerful factions—the merchant guilds, the noble houses, and the clergy—to find out who is pulling the strings.
*   **Act II — A Dance of Daggers (Sessions 4–7):** The conspiracy deepens as the party attends lavish masquerades, engages in honor duels in foggy alleyways, and steals incriminating ledgers from guarded villas. They learn the conspirators plan to strike during the festival's final night, the Grand Masquerade.
*   **Act III — The Unmasking (Sessions 8–12):** On the final night, the party must infiltrate the Doge's Palace during the Grand Masquerade. They have one chance to identify the assassins, expose the conspiracy's mastermind, and prevent the coup, all without revealing their own identities to the world.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Gilded Dove”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Social Stealth
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party receives their mission from their spymaster during the chaotic opening of the Festival.
    *   Their first task: investigate a minor noble known for his anti-government rhetoric. They must adopt personas to get close to him at a small, exclusive party.
    *   They discover the noble is merely a pawn, receiving coded messages via a specific breed of gilded carrier dove.
**Escalation:** The noble is assassinated by a masked figure before the party can interrogate him fully, leaving them with the only clue: one of the gilded doves.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Merchant of Lies”
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Faction Politics
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party traces the dove to a powerful merchant prince who secretly funds the conspiracy.
    *   They must use their personas to gain the trust of the merchant's guild or infiltrate his warehouse to find evidence.
    *   They discover a weapons shipment manifest, detailing a plan to arm a mercenary company loyal to the conspirators.
**Escalation:** The merchant, aware he is being investigated, uses his influence with the City Guard to place a bounty on one of the party's personas, forcing them to be careful about which masks they wear.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Duel at Dawn”
*   **Focus:** Intrigue / Action
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party learns the name of the conspiracy's leader: a rival noble thought to be a staunch ally of the Doge.
    *   To get proof, they must challenge the noble's champion to a formal (but non-lethal) duel, creating a distraction while another party member searches the noble's private study.
    *   They find a letter detailing the assassination plot for the Grand Masquerade.
**Escalation:** The duel is a trap. The conspirators use it as an opportunity to try and assassinate the party in a public, but deniable, fashion.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Lying Widow (Lady Annalisa)** — *The Spymaster*
    *   **Role:** The party's enigmatic and ruthless handler, leader of the Silent Hand.
    *   **Personality:** Poised, elegant, and always three steps ahead. She communicates through coded messages and clandestine meetings. She sees people as pieces on a board.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She founded the Silent Hand after her own family was destroyed in a previous, failed coup. Her desire to protect the Republic is rooted in a deep-seated fear of history repeating itself, making her overly cautious.

2.  **Captain Valerius** — *The Crooked Guard*
    *   **Role:** The seemingly honorable and respected Captain of the City Guard.
    *   **Personality:** Gruff, by-the-book, and presents himself as a man of the people. He is a pillar of the community.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is the secret leader of the conspiracy. He believes the Republic's decadent nobility is weak and that only his brand of military-enforced order can save the city from itself.

3.  **The Gilded Fool** — *The Wild Card*
    *   **Role:** A mysterious, influential figure who appears at every major festival event, always wearing a golden, smiling fool's mask.
    *   **Personality:** Whimsical, chaotic, and speaks only in riddles and jokes. He seems to know everyone's secrets and enjoys stirring the pot.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is the disgraced, exiled brother of the Doge. He doesn't want the coup to succeed, but he also wants to see his brother humiliated, so he helps and hinders the party in equal measure.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a cold war of information and identity. The central conflict is about preventing a civil war not with an army, but with a well-placed rumor, a stolen letter, or a perfectly timed unmasking. It forces players to rely on their wits, charm, and cunning, where the most powerful weapon is a secret.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Persona & Notoriety**
*   Each player maintains 2-3 **Personas**, each represented by a physical mask. Each Persona has its own name, backstory, and **Notoriety** score (from 0 to 5) with each major faction (Nobles, Guilds, Guard, etc.).
*   When a player takes an action, the DM decides if it raises Notoriety for their current Persona with a relevant faction. For example, being caught sneaking into a Guild warehouse would raise Notoriety with the Merchant's Guild.
*   If a Persona's Notoriety with a faction reaches 5, that Persona is **Compromised**. They are actively watched by that faction, making it impossible to act freely. This forces players to be strategic about which identity they use for which task.

### 2. **The Favor Economy**
*   In Venza, information and access are the true currency. Players can earn **Favors** (a tracked resource) from NPCs by completing tasks, providing them with secrets, or succeeding on social checks.
*   Favors can be spent as a tangible resource:
    *   **1 Favor:** Bribe a guard to look the other way; get a minor piece of gossip from a courtier.
    *   **3 Favors:** Gain an invitation to an exclusive party; have a minor official "misplace" a key document.
    *   **5 Favors:** Call in a squad of guards to create a major distraction; get a master forger to create a perfect replica of a seal.
