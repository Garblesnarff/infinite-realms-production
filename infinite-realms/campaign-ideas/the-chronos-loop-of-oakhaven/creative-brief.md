# Creative Brief: The Chronos Loop of Oakhaven

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gothic Folk Art (Don't Starve-inspired)

Inspired by the distinctive gothic, hand-drawn aesthetic of the video game *Don't Starve*. This style aims to capture the frustrating, intriguing, humorous, and desperate tone of "The Chronos Loop of Oakhaven," where a quaint village is trapped in a repeating time loop, and the familiar becomes subtly unsettling.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Hand-Drawn Quality:** Describe elements with strong, expressive linework and a slightly rough, illustrative feel.
*   **Subtle Unsettling:** The idyllic village should feel familiar but subtly off, hinting at the temporal anomaly without being overtly horrific.
*   **Atmospheric Details:** Use elements like fog, shadows, and stylized natural forms to create a pervasive sense of mystery and the subtly off-kilter nature of the repeating day.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Frustrating, intriguing, humorous, desperate, quaint, unsettling, repetitive, mysterious, gothic, folk art.
*   **Feeling:** A blend of charming village life and the quiet madness of repetition. The atmosphere should be one of persistent mystery, with moments of dark humor and growing desperation. The familiar becomes a cage.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Strong, bold, and expressive linework, giving a hand-drawn, almost ink-on-paper quality. Forms are stylized and often slightly angular or elongated, contributing to the gothic folk art feel. 
*   **Textures:** Suggested rather than highly detailed, focusing on the overall impression of wood, stone, and fabric, often with a slightly worn or rustic appearance.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital illustration in the style of Don't Starve. The focus is on a quaint village street, with strong, hand-drawn lines defining the wooden buildings and cobblestone path."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Muted, earthy, and often desaturated. Dominated by browns, greens, grays, and dull blues. Occasional pops of more vibrant color for specific details or to highlight a moment of humor or strangeness.
*   **Temporal Distortions:** Subtle shifts in hue or saturation can indicate temporal distortions or the unsettling nature of the loop.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a muted color palette of earthy browns and desaturated greens, with a single, vibrant red apple on a stall, hinting at the repeating nature of the day."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are stylized, often with slightly exaggerated features that convey their personality and the subtle oddities of Oakhaven. Villagers appear quaint and oblivious, while the players show increasing frustration or determination.
*   **Expression:** Faces are expressive, capable of conveying humor, confusion, or quiet desperation. Eyes are often wide and slightly unsettling.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A village mayor with a perpetually cheerful, slightly bumbling expression, rendered with strong, hand-drawn lines. His eyes are wide and unseeing, oblivious to the repeating day."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** The village of Oakhaven is quaint and idyllic, with traditional buildings, a town square, and surrounding natural elements like a whispering willow or an old mill. 
*   **Atmosphere:** Can shift from sunny and cheerful to foggy and mysterious. The environment should feel familiar and lived-in, but with subtle visual cues that hint at the repetition or the underlying mystery.
*   **Details:** Repetitive patterns in the background, subtle visual glitches (e.g., a flickering light, a momentarily duplicated object), or elements that appear slightly out of place upon closer inspection.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of the Oakhaven town square during a sunny festival day. The buildings are quaint and hand-drawn, but a subtle, almost imperceptible, shimmer distorts the air around a clock tower, hinting at a temporal anomaly."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Often uses strong, graphic shadows that define form and create mood, reminiscent of ink illustrations. Lighting can be natural and bright, or dim and mysterious, depending on the scene.
*   **Shadows:** Used to create depth, emphasize character forms, and hint at hidden elements or the unsettling nature of the loop. Shadows can be long and distorted.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of mystery, highlight moments of humor or desperation, and emphasize the subtle strangeness of the repeating day.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the warm, natural light of a sunny day, casting long, graphic shadows from the buildings onto the cobblestone street. A single, flickering lantern in a window suggests a hidden secret."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide shots to establish the village setting, and tighter shots to focus on character interactions or specific clues. Compositions can be slightly off-kilter to enhance the unsettling feel.
*   **Techniques:** Employ leading lines (e.g., paths, fences) to guide the eye. Frame characters within doorways or windows to emphasize their connection to the village. Use repetition of elements within the composition to subtly convey the time loop.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a character standing in the Oakhaven town square, looking at a group of villagers performing the same actions they did yesterday. The composition emphasizes the repetition, with subtle visual echoes of the previous day's events."

## Voice

A slightly manic, gender-neutral voice, reedy and strained, like a town crier on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The pacing is a frantic, looping, and repetitive rhythm, with sudden shifts in tone and volume that mirror the temporal distortions of Oakhaven. The emotion is a blend of forced cheerfulness, barely concealed hysteria, and a growing sense of existential dread. Audio quality is slightly distorted and lo-fi, as if broadcasting from an old, crackling radio, with a subtle, looping background hum that suggests the endless repetition. Role: The voice of the town's clock tower, or a villager who is slowly, maddeningly, becoming aware of the loop.
