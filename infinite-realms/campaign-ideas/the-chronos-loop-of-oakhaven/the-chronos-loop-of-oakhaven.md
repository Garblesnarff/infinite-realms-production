# The Chronos Loop of Oakhaven

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Time Loop / Mystery / Social Deduction
- **Estimated Length**: 8-10 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-5
- **Tone**: Frustrating, Intriguing, Humorous, Desperate

### Core Premise
The players awaken in the quaint, seemingly idyllic village of Oakhaven, only to discover they are trapped in a repeating time loop. Every morning, they wake up at the same time, in the same place, with the same events unfolding around them. The villagers are unaware of the loop, living out their day as if for the first time. The players, however, retain their memories and skills. They must use their unique predicament to investigate a central mystery – a murder, a missing artifact, or an impending disaster – that occurs within the loop, hoping that by solving it, they can break free from the endless cycle.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Groundhog Day (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players realize they are trapped in a time loop. Their initial attempts to break free are met with frustration and failure. They begin to explore Oakhaven, learning its routines, identifying key NPCs, and discovering the central mystery that repeats each day. They must convince each other of the loop's existence and start working together.

**Act 2: Unraveling the Thread (Sessions 4-7)**
- With each repetition, the players gather more clues, test theories, and manipulate events. They learn about the villagers' secrets, uncover hidden locations, and identify potential suspects or key moments within the loop. They might discover that someone else is aware of the loop, or even responsible for it.

**Act 3: Breaking the Cycle (Sessions 8-10)**
- The players identify the cause of the loop and the solution to the central mystery. They must execute a complex plan within a single iteration of the day, using all their accumulated knowledge and skills to solve the mystery, confront the perpetrator, or prevent the disaster. The campaign culminates in a climactic sequence that either breaks the loop, or traps them forever.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The First Day**: Players awaken in Oakhaven. They experience the day's events, perhaps a festival, a market day, or a quiet morning. The day ends, and they awaken again, realizing the loop. They must convince each other and begin to explore.
- **Session 2: Mapping the Day**: The players use the loop to their advantage, mapping Oakhaven, learning NPC routines, and testing minor interactions. They identify the central mystery (e.g., a murder that occurs at noon, a valuable item that disappears).
- **Session 3: The Frustration**: Initial attempts to solve the mystery or break the loop fail spectacularly, leading to humorous or desperate situations. They might try to warn villagers, only to be dismissed as mad.
- **Session 4-5: Deepening the Investigation**: The players use their knowledge of the loop to gather specific clues, interrogate NPCs (who forget the next day), and access restricted areas. They might discover a hidden passage or a secret meeting.
- **Session 6-7: The Aware One**: They encounter an NPC who seems subtly aware of the loop, or who is acting suspiciously. This NPC might be the cause, a victim, or another trapped individual.
- **Session 8: The Loop's Origin**: The players discover the magical artifact, ritual, or entity responsible for the time loop. They learn what needs to be done to break it, which is directly tied to solving the central mystery.
- **Session 9-10: The Perfect Day**: The players execute their plan. This is a multi-stage, high-stakes sequence where every action must be precise. They must solve the mystery, confront the perpetrator, and perform the necessary action to break the loop, all within the confines of a single, repeating day.

### Major NPCs

- **Mayor Thistlewick**: The perpetually cheerful, oblivious mayor of Oakhaven. **Role**: Recurring NPC / Source of Information. **Personality**: Optimistic, a bit bumbling, and always focused on the day's events. **Flaw/Secret**: He has a secret, embarrassing hobby or a minor past indiscretion that the players can exploit to gain information.
- **The Chronomancer (Antagonist/Cause)**: The individual or entity responsible for the time loop. **Role**: Antagonist / Ambiguous Figure. **Personality**: Varies (e.g., a mad wizard trying to perfect a spell, a benevolent entity trying to prevent a greater disaster, a mischievous fey). **Flaw/Secret**: Their motivations are complex, and they might not even be aware of the players' predicament.
- **Old Man Hemlock**: The village eccentric, who occasionally mutters cryptic warnings or seems to have fleeting moments of déjà vu. **Role**: Cryptic Informant. **Personality**: Grumpy, isolated, and often dismissed by the villagers. **Flaw/Secret**: He was present when the loop was created and has a fragmented memory of the event, but struggles to articulate it.

### Key Locations

- **The Oakhaven Town Square**: The central hub of the village, where many of the day's key events unfold.
- **The Whispering Willow**: An ancient tree on the outskirts of town, rumored to have magical properties, and potentially connected to the loop's origin.
- **The Old Mill**: A disused building that might hold a clue, a hidden passage, or the loop's magical anchor.
- **The Chronomancer's Hidden Lair**: The secret location where the loop was initiated, perhaps a magically warded basement or a pocket dimension.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to break free from an endless cycle and reclaim their agency, while solving a mystery that is constantly resetting. It's a test of observation, deduction, and creative problem-solving against the relentless march of time.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Memory & Manipulation**: Players retain all knowledge, skills, and items acquired *before* the loop began. Any items acquired *during* the loop disappear at the reset, but knowledge gained persists. This encourages players to experiment wildly, knowing there are no permanent consequences within the loop. They can use their knowledge of future events to manipulate NPCs, set up elaborate traps, or gather information that would otherwise be impossible. However, repeated failures or overly aggressive manipulations might cause subtle "temporal distortions" – minor, unpredictable changes to the day's events that make it harder to predict outcomes. This mechanic rewards cleverness and experimentation while adding a layer of unpredictability.
