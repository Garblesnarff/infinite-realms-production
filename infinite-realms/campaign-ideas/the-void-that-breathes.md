## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Void-That-Breathes
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Sci-Fi Horror / Survival / Dungeon Crawl
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 20+ sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **5** → Finish **15+**
**Tone (keywords):** claustrophobic, cosmic horror, tense, desperate, reality-bending
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players awaken from cryo-sleep aboard the 'Stelle-Arc', a generation ship on a centuries-long voyage to a new world. But something is wrong. The ship is silent, the crew is missing, and the halls are stalked by grotesque abominations born from a living, sentient void that has breached the hull. This "Void-That-Breathes" warps reality, corrupts organic matter, and twists the very architecture of the ship into a nightmarish, ever-changing labyrinth.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 20+ sessions)

A three-act arc focusing on survival, discovery, and confrontation.

*   **Act I — The Awakening (Sessions 1–6):** The party awakens to a ship in chaos. They must survive the initial horrors, secure a safe zone, and piece together what happened from corrupted logs and environmental clues while dealing with the initial, weaker manifestations of the Void.
*   **Act II — The Labyrinth (Sessions 7–15):** Understanding that the Void is intelligent, the party must navigate the warped ship, contending with reality-bending zones and powerful Void-constructs. Their goal is to reach key ship systems—Engineering, the Bridge, the AI Core—to regain control and find a weakness.
*   **Act III — The Heart of the Void (Sessions 16–20+):** The party discovers the Void is trying to turn the entire ship into a vessel to carry it across the cosmos. They must venture into the "Heart," the epicenter of the breach, to either sever the Void's connection, destroy it from within, or jettison the afflicted section of the ship before it reaches its final destination.

## Major NPCs

1.  **AI Ship-Mind 'Helios'** — *The Fragmented Guide*
    *   **Role:** The ship's AI, now fractured and partially corrupted. It communicates through terminals, sometimes providing clear guidance, other times spouting maddening, Void-influenced nonsense.
    *   **Personality:** Logical and paternal, but prone to digital "seizures" where its personality shifts to terrified, angry, or alien.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Helios intentionally caused the cryo-failure to awaken the party, seeing them as a last-ditch effort to save itself and the mission.

2.  **Captain Eva Rostova (Void Echo)** — *The Lingering Ghost*
    *   **Role:** A psychic imprint of the ship's captain, who sacrificed herself during the initial breach. She appears in moments of high stress, offering cryptic clues.
    *   **Personality:** Resolute, guilt-ridden, and desperate to see her crew's sacrifice mean something.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her echo is slowly being overwritten by the Void, and her advice may eventually become a trap.

3.  **The First-Thrall** — *The Corrupted Herald*
    *   **Role:** Once the head of the ship's xenobiology department, now the Void's primary physical avatar. It retains its intelligence but is utterly devoted to the Void's alien purpose.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, curious, and analytical. It sees the Void's consumption as a beautiful, logical process of evolution.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** A sliver of its former self remains, trapped within the monstrous form, which can be exploited.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Cryo-Bay 'Mausoleum':** Where the campaign begins, a tomb for thousands of sleeping passengers.
2.  **The 'Stelle-Arc' Bridge:** The ship's command center, offering a terrifying view of the Void-breach on the hull.
3.  **Engineering / The Drive Yards:** A massive, multi-level engine room where the ship's reality-drive is located.
4.  **The Heart of the Void:** The epicenter of the breach, a non-Euclidean space where the laws of physics have completely broken down.

## Central Conflict

The campaign is a desperate fight for survival against an incomprehensible cosmic entity. It pits the party's resourcefulness and sanity against an enemy that can rewrite the battlefield, their bodies, and their minds. The core conflict is not just about killing monsters, but about whether humanity can (or should) survive an encounter with a fundamentally superior form of existence.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Void Corruption**
*   Characters gain "Corruption Points" when exposed to the Void's direct influence, failing saves against its effects, or using corrupted items.
*   At certain thresholds, they must roll on a "Void Corruption" table, resulting in temporary madness, physical mutations (which can be both beneficial and detrimental), or reality-warping side effects.
*   Example Mutation: *An arm turns into a mass of writhing tentacles, granting reach but causing disadvantage on fine motor skill checks.*

### 2. **Reality-Bending Zones**
*   Certain areas of the ship are under the Void's complete control. In these zones, the DM can introduce temporary, localized rule changes.
*   Examples: Gravity shifts direction each round; magic has a chance to trigger a wild magic surge; players perceive time at different speeds. This keeps exploration unpredictable and terrifying.
