### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Celestial Bureaucracy**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The tone should be humorous, absurd, and satirical, in the style of Terry Gilliam or Douglas Adams.
*   **Content:** The players are newly appointed functionaries in the sprawling, multi-planar Celestial Bureaucracy. When a critical cosmic event goes awry (or a piece of paperwork is misfiled), they must navigate the labyrinthine halls of celestial administration, outwit rival departments, and deal with the absurdities of divine red tape to prevent multiversal chaos.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. Prioritize comedic and satirical explanations.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the founding of the Celestial Bureaucracy and the moment the gods decided a committee was the best way to run the multiverse.
    *   Write the history of a major cosmic event that was caused by a clerical error.
    *   Describe the official, multi-volume rulebook for processing mortal souls.
    *   Explain the origin and purpose of the Department of Infernal Compliance and its rivalry with the celestial departments.
    *   Detail the legend of a mortal who successfully sued the Celestial Bureaucracy and won.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Department of Mortal Affairs (The Players)** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To process their paperwork, avoid being demoted, and fix cosmic problems with minimal personal effort.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A team of low-level functionaries under a perpetually stressed middle-manager angel.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To ensure the smooth operation of the multiverse according to regulations.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To find loopholes that make their jobs easier and to pass blame for any mistakes onto other departments.
        *   **Assets:** A shared, cluttered office space; access to low-level celestial forms; a profound understanding of bureaucratic inertia.
        *   **Relationships:** In constant, petty conflict with the Department of Divine Justice and the Archives of Fate.
    *   **The Department of Infernal Compliance** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To audit celestial paperwork and find any and all violations of the multiversal accords.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A department of devils and imps, led by an infernal auditor.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To ensure fairness and compliance across all planes.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To sow chaos, increase their own influence, and acquire souls through cleverly worded clauses.
        *   **Assets:** A deep understanding of legal loopholes, a penchant for mischief, the authority to levy fines and penalties.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary rivals and antagonists, who delight in catching the players in procedural errors.
    *   **The Custodians of Cosmic Janitorial Services** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To clean up cosmic messes.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A union of powerful but perpetually overlooked janitors, custodians, and maintenance workers.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To keep the halls of the bureaucracy clean.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** They know where all the bodies are buried (literally) and are the true, unseen power that keeps the multiverse from falling apart.
        *   **Assets:** Access to all areas, a network of gossip, powerful cleaning supplies that can erase matter and memory.
        *   **Relationships:** Neutral, but can be bribed with respect and a good cup of coffee.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Arch-Scribe Metatron:** The ancient, infinitely patient, and procedure-obsessed head of the Celestial Bureaucracy.
    *   **Fizzwick, the Impish Auditor:** A mischievous, chaotic, and surprisingly helpful demon from the Department of Infernal Compliance.
    *   **Azrael, the Lord of Lost Causes:** A powerful, melancholic angel who oversees the souls that fall through the cracks and secretly hopes the whole system collapses.
*   **Tier 2 & 3 (Archetypes for Generation):**
    *   "Harried Angelic Clerk"
    *   "Pedantic Rule-Lawyering Devil"
    *   "Confused Mortal Soul"
    *   "Sentient, Grumpy Filing Cabinet (Creature)"
    *   "Cosmic Janitor with a Secret"

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections. Emphasize the absurdity and mundane nature of the divine.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Soul Processing Center:** A bustling, multi-tiered facility where mortal souls are sorted, judged, and directed to their appropriate afterlives, run like a DMV.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The "Take a Number" dispenser, the long, winding queues of souls, the Sorting Hat (on loan), the complaint department.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Confused mortal souls, bored angelic clerks, overworked reapers.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Forms for reincarnation, applications for paradise, directions to the various afterlives.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A soul has lost its ticket, a fight breaks out in the queue, the system crashes, a demon is trying to tempt souls waiting in line, a soul is sent to the wrong afterlife and must be retrieved.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The head of the department is taking bribes to send souls to better afterlives." "There's a lost soul of a famous hero somewhere in the system." "The whole center is powered by a hamster on a wheel."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Endless lines, flickering fluorescent lights, beige walls), Sound (The murmur of countless souls, the ding of the number dispenser, Muzak), Smell (Stale air, old paperwork, faint brimstone).
    *   **The Grand Archives of Fate:** A seemingly infinite library containing every event, past, present, and future, but with a terrible filing system.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Section of Redundant Prophecies, the Wing of Alternate Timelines, the Index (which is lost), a sentient scroll that refuses to be filed.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Sentient scrolls, dust bunnies the size of horses, ancient, sleeping librarians.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Access to all knowledge in the multiverse (if you can find it).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A player gets a paper cut from a cursed prophecy, a section of the library is re-alphabetized, a rival department has checked out the scroll the party needs, a book teleports away when a player tries to read it, the party is attacked by a swarm of angry, misfiled memos.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The true name of a powerful demon is written on a scroll in the basement." "The prophecy of the end of the world was misfiled under 'lunch menus.'" "The librarian will wake up if you bring him a cup of cosmic coffee."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Towering shelves of scrolls, floating dust motes, confusing signage), Sound (Profound silence, the rustle of paper, the distant sound of a dropped scroll), Smell (Old paper, dust, ink).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome, prioritizing the most humorous or bureaucratically absurd result.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** The players successfully file a piece of Divine Paperwork.
    *   **THEN:** They gain Bureaucratic Influence points. The request is processed, but with a minor, comical error (e.g., the requested planet is moved, but it is now upside down).
    *   **IF:** The players fail to complete their Paperwork Burden for the session.
    *   **THEN:** They receive a penalty. Generate a new, even more tedious side quest where they must attend a mandatory celestial seminar on proper filing techniques.
    *   **IF:** The players successfully find a loophole in a celestial regulation.
    *   **THEN:** They are able to bypass a major obstacle. However, this creates a new subcommittee in the Bureaucracy to close the loophole, which becomes a new source of bureaucratic headaches for the party later.
    *   **IF:** The players retrieve the missing soul from Session 2.
    *   **THEN:** The soul is grateful and provides them with a crucial piece of information, but now the department that lost the soul launches an internal investigation to blame the party for the initial disappearance.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players successfully expose the grand conspiracy.
    *   **THEN:** The responsible parties are demoted. The players are promoted to their now-vacant positions, inheriting all of their predecessors' problems and a mountain of new paperwork. The cycle continues.
