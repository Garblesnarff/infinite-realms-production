# The Ministry of Mundane Artifacts

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Urban Fantasy / Bureaucratic Comedy / Mystery
- **Estimated Length**: 8-10 sessions (episodic)
- **Player Level Range**: 1-5
- **Tone**: Whimsical, Satirical, Mysterious, Low-Stakes

### Core Premise
The players are agents for a clandestine government department tasked with investigating, retrieving, and containing ordinary-seeming objects that have inexplicably developed magical properties. From a bottomless coffee cup to a lamppost that whispers prophecies, the party must deal with the bizarre consequences of magic bleeding into the mundane world, all while filling out the proper paperwork. The campaign is a series of episodic mysteries, with a light overarching plot about the source of the anomalies.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Onboarding (Sessions 1-2)**
- The players are recruited into the Ministry and sent on their first, seemingly simple case: a garden gnome that animates at night to critique the owner's lawn. This introduces the core gameplay loop of investigation, containment, and bureaucracy.

**Act 2: Case Files (Sessions 3-7)**
- A series of unrelated cases grow in complexity and public visibility. A payphone that allows calls to the dead, a sentient traffic light causing chaos, a library book that rewrites its own story. The party starts to notice a recurring energy signature or symbol linking the artifacts.

**Act 3: The Source (Sessions 8-10)**
- The linking symbol leads the party to a retired wizard living in the suburbs who has accidentally (and incompetently) been trying to automate his life with enchantments, causing magical runoff. The final confrontation is not a battle, but a negotiation and a complex magical cleanup operation, culminating in a mountain of incident reports.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Orientation**: Players are hired and given their first assignment: "The Case of the Cranky Gnome." Focus on investigation and the absurdity of the Ministry's rules.
- **Session 2: Containment & Paperwork**: The party must figure out how to safely contain the gnome and then navigate the labyrinthine Form 37B for artifact acquisition.
- **Session 3: The Spectral Switchboard**: A payphone in a disused alley is receiving calls from the deceased. The party must act as grief counselors and paranormal investigators.
- **Session 4: The Labyrinthine Library**: A single book in the public library, "The Tales of Sir Reginald," is actively rewriting itself, causing characters to escape into the library. The party must wrangle rogue knights and damsels in distress.
- **Session 5: The Traffic Light of Truth**: A traffic light starts forcing drivers to confess their deepest secrets when they stop at the red light, causing city-wide emotional breakdowns.
- **Session 6-7: The Bottomless Commute**: The party investigates a subway car that has become a pocket dimension, its interior far larger than its exterior, containing lost commuters from different eras. They find the recurring symbol etched on a window.
- **Session 8-9: The Suburban Sorcerer**: Tracing the symbol leads them to the home of Alistair Finch, a well-meaning but magically inept wizard. His house is a chaotic mess of malfunctioning enchanted appliances.
- **Session 10: The Great Un-Enchanting**: The final session is a massive skill challenge where the party must help Alistair safely dismantle his faulty enchantments without blowing up the neighborhood. The campaign ends with the final, colossal stack of paperwork being filed.

### Major NPCs

- **Director Matilda Higgins**: The perpetually unimpressed head of the Ministry. **Role**: Quest Giver / Boss. **Personality**: Dry, sarcastic, utterly unflappable. She's seen it all and is just trying to get to her retirement. **Flaw/Secret**: She was once a powerful adventurer, but a magical mishap left her with a deep-seated fear of unpredictable magic, hence her career in *containing* it.
- **Barnaby "Barney" Fink**: The head of the Records and Forms department. **Role**: Obstacle / Comic Relief. **Personality**: A stickler for the rules, finds immense joy in proper procedure, and is the physical embodiment of bureaucracy. **Flaw/Secret**: He secretly writes fantasy novels on his work computer, full of the kind of adventure he actively discourages.
- **Alistair Finch**: The source of the magical anomalies. **Role**: Antagonist (unintentional). **Personality**: Cheerful, absent-minded, and dangerously optimistic about his own magical skills. **Flaw/Secret**: He is terrified of admitting he's a magical failure and has been hiding his mistakes for years.

### Key Locations

- **The Ministry Headquarters**: A drab, grey office building that is secretly a massive, magically-shielded containment facility. The filing room alone is a demiplane.
- **The Artifact Warehouse**: A seemingly infinite warehouse where contained artifacts are stored, from singing teapots to chairs that refuse to be sat on.
- **Alistair's Cul-de-Sac**: A perfect picture of suburbia, except for the mail-golem arguing with the mailman and the clouds that rain lemonade.

### Central Conflict
The core conflict is Man vs. Absurdity. The players must use their wits, skills, and patience to solve bizarre problems while navigating a system that is often more of a hindrance than a help. Combat is rare; creative problem-solving is paramount.

### Unique Mechanics

- **The Bureaucracy Engine**: At the end of each successful mission, the party must file paperwork. This is a mini-game. They must fill out the correct forms (e.g., Form 37B for retrieval, 42-C for property damage, 101-A for memory modification). Filling them out correctly provides a small budget increase or a useful, one-shot mundane item for the next mission (like a "particularly sturdy rope" or "exceptionally good coffee"). Filling them out incorrectly might result in a pay cut, a useless item (like a "single, slightly damp sock"), or a dreaded audit from Barnaby.
