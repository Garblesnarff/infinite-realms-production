# Creative Brief: Dust Devil's Due

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gritty Post-Apocalyptic Western

Inspired by the desolate, survival-focused worlds of *Mad Max* and *Fallout*, blended with the iconic imagery of classic Spaghetti Westerns. This style aims to capture the harsh beauty of a broken world, where humanity clings to existence amidst vast, unforgiving landscapes and the strange remnants of a forgotten past.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Desolation and Scale:** Convey the vastness of the desert and the isolation of settlements. Characters should often feel small against the backdrop of the ruined world.
*   **Function Over Form:** Every object, vehicle, and piece of clothing should look like it serves a purpose and has been repaired countless times. Scars, rust, and wear are essential details.
*   **Harsh Realism:** The world is brutal. Lighting should be stark, and textures should be rough and tangible.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Desolate, gritty, survivalist, sun-baked, mysterious, harsh, retro-futuristic, Western.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of constant struggle against the environment and desperate factions. Hope is a rare commodity, but resilience is abundant. The world is dangerous but also holds secrets and forgotten wonders.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and detailed, with a focus on conveying texture and the effects of weathering. Lines should be sharp and defined where appropriate (e.g., on metal edges), but softened by dust and wear.
*   **Forms:** Architecture is often ramshackle and improvised, built from scavenged materials. Vehicles are heavily modified and armored. Characters are lean and hardened.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting. The focus is on the rusted, pitted metal of a modified sand-skiff and the cracked, sun-baked earth stretching to the horizon."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by warm, earthy tones: various shades of brown, orange, ochre, and desaturated reds for the desert. Sky is often a pale, washed-out blue or a fiery orange at sunset.
*   **Accents:** Occasional pops of color come from faded paint on vehicles, worn fabrics, or the strange glow of ancient technology (e.g., a faint green or blue from a power core).
*   **Lighting Influence:** Colors are heavily influenced by the harsh desert sun, leading to strong highlights and deep, often warm, shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a color palette dominated by sun-bleached browns, dusty oranges, and a pale, cloudless sky, with a subtle, eerie green glow emanating from a piece of ancient tech."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are rugged, weathered, and practical. Clothing is layered, patched, and functional, often a mix of old Western wear and scavenged protective gear.
*   **Features:** Faces are often sun-baked, scarred, and expressive of hardship and determination. Goggles, bandanas, and wide-brimmed hats are common.
*   **Gear:** Weapons are often custom-built or heavily modified. Tools are essential and visible.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A grizzled Dust-Runner, face weathered by sun and sand, wearing a patched leather duster, a wide-brimmed hat, and goggles. A modified lever-action rifle is slung across their back."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast, open desert landscapes are paramount. Settlements are small, fortified oases or ramshackle towns built from scrap.
*   **Details:** Wind-swept dunes, mesas, canyons, and the skeletal remains of pre-Scouring structures (skyscrapers half-buried in sand, rusted bridges). Dust devils are a common sight.
*   **Atmosphere:** A constant sense of dust, heat, and dryness. Mirages shimmer on the horizon.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of an endless, red-sand desert under a scorching sun. In the distance, the rusted skeletal remains of a skyscraper pierce the hazy sky. A small, fortified oasis town is nestled in a canyon."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Harsh, high-key lighting during the day, with strong, defined shadows. Sunsets are dramatic, casting long, warm shadows.
*   **Light Sources:** The sun is the dominant light source. Indoors or at night, light comes from flickering lanterns, campfires, or the dim glow of salvaged electronics.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes the harshness of the environment and the struggle for survival. It can also create a sense of mystery in the shadows of ruins.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the harsh, direct light of the midday sun, creating sharp, deep shadows that define the contours of the landscape and the figures."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often wide and cinematic, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the isolation of the characters. Can also be tight and claustrophobic in interior spaces.
*   **Techniques:** Use leading lines (tire tracks, canyons) to draw the eye into the distance. Frame characters against epic backdrops. Silhouettes against sunsets or sunrises are iconic.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a caravan of sand-skiffs moving across a vast, flat salt-pan, dwarfed by the endless horizon. The composition emphasizes the isolation and scale."

## Voice

An old, gravelly male voice, dry and cracked like the sun-baked earth, with a slow, deliberate Western drawl. His pacing is as unhurried as a tumbleweed, each word carrying the weight of a thousand dusty miles. The emotion is a blend of world-weary cynicism and a grim, unyielding determination, like the last embers of a dying campfire. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, but with a subtle, almost imperceptible, layer of fine dust and the distant, mournful howl of the desert wind. Role: The grizzled prospector of the wastes, or the voice of the desert itself, whispering forgotten tales.
