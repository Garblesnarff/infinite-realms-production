## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A journey across a dying world to stop a second apocalypse.

*   **Act I — The Salt-Pan Run (Sessions 1–5):** The party takes the job and must guide their charge across the treacherous Great Salt-Pans. They'll fend off dune-raiders, hunt mutated desert beasts, and face the constant threat of dehydration and exposure.
*   **Act II — The Sunken City (Sessions 6–10):** The scholar reveals their destination: the ruins of a pre-Scouring metropolis. Deep within, the party discovers a massive, dormant "Weather-Engine." They also learn of the "Children of the Scouring," a cult that worships the cataclysm and seeks to reactivate the Engine to finish its work.
*   **Act III — The Maelstrom (Sessions 11–15+):** The Children of the Scouring steal a vital component from the Engine and retreat to their fortress, a stronghold built inside a perpetual, continent-sized sandstorm known as the Maelstrom. The party must give chase, navigate the storm, and confront the cult's leader before they can bring about a final, world-ending drought.

## Major NPCs

1.  **"One-Shot" Sal** — *The Veteran Dust-Runner*
    *   **Role:** The grizzled, pragmatic leader of the Dust-Runner's guild in Rust-Rock. She acts as a mentor and quest-giver.
    *   **Personality:** Tough, cynical, and doesn't waste words. She's seen dozens of crews like the party's die in the sands, but she holds a sliver of hope for them.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She was part of a team that discovered the Sunken City years ago. The expedition ended in disaster, and she has kept the city's location a secret ever since, wracked with guilt.

2.  **Professor Alistair Finch** — *The Client*
    *   **Role:** The frail, elderly scholar who hires the party.
    *   **Personality:** Obsessive, brilliant, and single-minded. He is an expert on pre-Scouring history and technology and believes the Weather-Engine can be used to restore the world.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His obsession is driven by the fact that his ancestors were the ones who built the Engine. He sees restoring the world as his family's duty, a burden that makes him reckless.

3.  **The First Son** — *The Antagonist*
    *   **Role:** The charismatic and fanatical leader of the Children of the Scouring.
    *   **Personality:** Calm, messianic, and utterly convinced that the Scouring was a divine event meant to purify a decadent world. He believes that life is suffering and that a final, all-consuming desert is the true paradise.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is a powerful psion (aberrant mind sorcerer) whose powers are slowly killing him. He wants to activate the Engine before he dies, seeing it as his only chance at leaving a meaningful legacy.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Oasis of Rust-Rock:** A bustling, dirty hub of trade and survival, built around a single, precious spring.
2.  **The Great Salt-Pans:** A vast, flat expanse of cracked salt, where mirages can be deadly and giant, crystalline scorpions hunt.
3.  **The Sunken City of Aeridor:** A pre-Scouring metropolis buried by sand, a dungeon filled with lost technology and ghosts of the past.
4.  **The Maelstrom:** A continent-sized, perpetual sandstorm. At its eye is the Children of the Scouring's fortress, built from the wreckage of ships that have crashed there over the decades.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores themes of hope and nihilism in a dying world. It asks whether it's better to risk everything to reclaim a lost past or to accept a harsh reality. The central conflict is a race against time to stop a doomsday cult, forcing the party to become heroes in a world that has forgotten what they look like.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Scarcity & Survival**
*   Water is the most valuable resource, tracked in **Waterskins**. Each character must consume one Waterskin per day of travel, or two in extreme heat, or suffer levels of **Exhaustion**.
*   Food is scarce, and ammunition for any ranged weapons is not easily replaced. The party must hunt, salvage, and trade to keep their supplies up. This makes resource management a core, strategic part of exploration.

### 2. **Weird Science Crafting**
*   The world is littered with the arcane-tech of the past. Players can find **Scoured Components** in ruins or by harvesting them from mutated creatures.
*   With a **Schematic** (found, bought, or stolen), players with the right tool proficiencies can use these components to craft unique "Weird West" items.
*   *Examples: A "Hex-Shooter" (a wand shaped like a revolver that can be loaded with spell-infused cartridges), "Alchemical Dynamite," a "Sand-Skiff" for desert travel, or a "Moisture Condenser" to slowly generate water.
