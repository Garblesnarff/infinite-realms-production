# Creative Brief: Against the Titans

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Epic Scale Realism (Monster Hunter/Shadow of the Colossus-inspired)

Inspired by the breathtaking scale and visceral combat of *Monster Hunter: World* and the awe-inspiring encounters of *Shadow of the Colossus*. This style aims to capture the epic, high-action, and challenging nature of hunting colossal Titans, where the creatures themselves are living dungeons and forces of nature.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Scale:** Always highlight the immense size of the Titans relative to their environment and the human hunters. Use terms like "colossal," "gargantuan," "dwarfing," and "mountain-sized."
*   **Dynamic Action:** Depict characters in motion, engaged in daring maneuvers, climbing, or attacking. The scene should feel alive and full of energy.
*   **Environmental Interaction:** Show how the Titans interact with and alter the landscape, and how hunters use the environment to their advantage.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Epic, colossal, high-action, challenging, adventurous, awe-inspiring, monumental, visceral, survival.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of overwhelming power and the thrill of confronting the impossible. The atmosphere should be one of intense focus and determination, with moments of breathtaking wonder at the sheer scale of the creatures.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Highly realistic and detailed, with a focus on conveying the texture and mass of the Titans. Lines are precise for human characters and gear, but can be more organic and rugged for the creatures.
*   **Forms:** Titans are depicted with immense, often geological or biological forms, showing their age and power. Human characters are realistically proportioned, emphasizing their agility and ingenuity against the behemoths.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Monster Hunter World. The focus is on the rough, craggy hide of a colossal, mountain-sized Titan, with tiny human figures scaling its back."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Naturalistic and often earthy, reflecting vast landscapes (blues for sky, greens for foliage, browns/grays for rock). Colors are rich and vibrant, but can become muted or dramatic during intense encounters or under specific lighting conditions.
*   **Titan Colors:** Titans often blend with their environment (e.g., a Petramach is earthy, a Fulminox is storm-colored, a Leviathan is abyssal), but with unique, distinguishing features or glowing weak points.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a naturalistic color palette dominated by the deep greens of a vast forest and the earthy browns of a colossal Titan, with a striking accent of glowing orange from a weak point on its hide."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Human characters are realistically proportioned, often wearing practical, rugged gear designed for survival and combat against massive foes. Armor is functional but can incorporate elements harvested from previous hunts, giving it a unique, trophy-like appearance.
*   **Titans:** Each Titan is a unique, awe-inspiring creature, blending animalistic, geological, or elemental features. Their designs should convey immense power, ancient age, and a sense of being a living force of nature.
*   **Expression:** Human faces are often determined, focused, or show the strain of battle. Titans have a primal, often indifferent, expression.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An elite Slayer, clad in armor crafted from the hide and bone of a previous Titan, wields a massive, oversized greatsword. They are poised to strike at the leg of a colossal, walking mountain Titan."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast, open landscapes that emphasize the scale of the Titans and the journey of the hunters. These environments are often dynamic and can be altered by the Titans themselves.
*   **Atmosphere:** Can range from clear, bright days to stormy, dust-filled plains, or the crushing darkness of the ocean depths. Weather effects are often tied to the Titans themselves.
*   **Details:** Scarred earth, pulverized forests, massive footprints, and the occasional remains of previous hunts. The environment is both a challenge and a tool for the Slayers.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of a vast, windswept plain, scarred by the passage of a colossal, walking mountain Titan. Tiny human figures are seen tracking its destructive path, dwarfed by the sheer scale of the landscape."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic and often naturalistic lighting. Sunlight is harsh and defines the contours of the Titans. During battles, light sources can be dynamic (explosions, energy attacks, lightning).
*   **Shadows:** Long, deep shadows that emphasize the scale of the Titans and create a sense of depth and drama. Shadows can also be used to hide hunters or obscure parts of the creature.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to convey the epic scale, the intensity of the action, and the awe-inspiring nature of the Titans.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the harsh, direct sunlight, casting long, imposing shadows from the colossal Titan across the landscape. The lighting emphasizes the creature's immense size and power."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, cinematic shots to capture the full scale of the Titans and their environment. Can also use dynamic, action-oriented shots that emphasize the struggle of the hunters.
*   **Techniques:** Employ forced perspective to highlight the size difference between hunters and Titans. Use leading lines (e.g., the Titan's body, environmental features) to guide the eye. Frame characters against the vastness of the Titans or the landscape. Dynamic angles (low-angle looking up at a Titan, high-angle looking down on a hunter) are effective.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot from a low angle, looking up at the colossal, storm-wreathed Fulminox as it descends from the sky. Tiny human figures are seen preparing their weapons on a mountain peak below, emphasizing the overwhelming scale of the beast."

## Voice

A deep, gravelly male voice, like stone grinding against stone, carrying the weight of countless battles. His standard American accent is weathered and seasoned, with a measured pacing that allows the immense scale of the Titans to sink in. The emotion is a profound mix of awestruck reverence and grim determination, reflecting the impossible odds. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, echoing resonance that hints at vast, open landscapes and the thunderous roars of colossal beasts. Role: A grizzled veteran hunter recounting tales of impossible hunts, or the ancient voice of the land itself.
