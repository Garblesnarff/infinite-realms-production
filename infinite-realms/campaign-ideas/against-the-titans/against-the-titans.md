In a world where civilization exists in the shadows of Titans—colossal monsters that are living forces of nature—the players are members of the elite Slayer's Guild. They are the only ones brave and foolish enough to hunt these city-destroying behemoths. Each arc of the campaign is a grand hunt, forcing the party to research their colossal prey, track it across vast territories, prepare the battlefield, and finally, engage in a multi-stage, epic battle against a creature the size of a mountain.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A series of epic hunts against impossible odds.

*   **Act I — The Earth-Shaker (Levels 3–7):** The party undertakes their first major contract: to hunt and kill the Petramach, a walking mountain of earth and stone whose migrations are pulverizing the kingdom's farmlands. They must learn its patterns, discover its weaknesses, and find a way to bring it down.
*   **Act II — The Sky-Tyrant (Levels 8–12):** Now a renowned Slayer crew, the party is hired to defeat the Fulminox, a colossal, storm-wreathed bird of prey that has made its nest on the highest mountain peak. The hunt will involve a perilous climb, aerial combat, and a final confrontation in the heart of a perpetual thunderstorm.
*   **Act III — The World-Serpent (Levels 13–15+):** A cataclysmic, world-ending Titan, the Leviathan, awakens in the abyssal depths of the ocean. The party, now legendary Slayers, must use all the knowledge and powerful gear they have crafted to venture into the crushing dark and confront the beast in its own element to save the world from being drowned by a final, apocalyptic tidal wave.

## Session-by-Session Outline (Example for Act I)

### Session 1 — “The Contract”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Research
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party accepts the contract for the Petramach at the Slayer's Guildhall.
    *   They are given access to the Guild's library and must research the Titan, speaking with scholars and veteran Slayers to learn about its supposed weaknesses and behavior.
    *   They learn the Titan's shell is impenetrable, but legends speak of a weak point on its underbelly.
**Escalation:** A rival Slayer crew tries to steal the contract and sabotage the party's research, believing the glory belongs to them.

### Sessions 2-4 — “On the Trail of a Mountain”
*   **Focus:** Exploration / Tracking / Skill Challenge
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must track the Petramach across a vast plain. This is a multi-day skill challenge involving Survival, Nature, and Perception checks.
    *   They must navigate the path of destruction left by the Titan, dealing with displaced local fauna (like angry Bulettes) and treacherous terrain.
    *   They discover the Titan's feeding ground: a massive crystal-filled cavern, where it consumes minerals to strengthen its shell.
**Escalation:** The party realizes the Titan is not just wandering; it is heading directly for a major, fortified city. The timeline for the hunt is suddenly much shorter.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Belly of the Beast”
*   **Focus:** Epic Boss Battle / The Titan as a Dungeon
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must execute their plan to bring down the Petramach. This is a multi-stage battle.
    *   **Stage 1:** They must use explosives or environmental hazards to destroy the Titan's legs and topple it.
    *   **Stage 2:** They must climb the Titan's body (now a treacherous, moving dungeon) to reach the weak spot on its belly.
    *   **Stage 3:** They must fight their way inside the creature to destroy its heart, a massive, glowing crystal.
**Escalation:** When the Titan is wounded, it releases a swarm of smaller, elemental parasites from its shell to defend itself.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Guildmaster Valerius** — *The Veteran*
    *   **Role:** The grizzled, one-legged former Slayer who runs the Guild. He is the party's mentor and quest-giver.
    *   **Personality:** Gruff, no-nonsense, and deeply respected. He lost his leg to a Titan years ago and pushes his Slayers hard, knowing that the slightest mistake can be fatal.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is haunted by the memory of the Titan that crippled him and is secretly obsessed with finding it again, a quest for revenge that might endanger the entire Guild.

2.  **Professor Arkwright** — *The Titanologist*
    *   **Role:** The Guild's resident scholar, an expert on Titan biology and behavior.
    *   **Personality:** Eccentric, brilliant, and always excited by a new discovery. He is more interested in studying the Titans than killing them, and he often asks the party to undertake risky, secondary objectives for the sake of science.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He believes the Titans are not monsters, but a necessary part of the world's ecosystem. He fears that killing too many of them could have a catastrophic, unforeseen consequence.

3.  **"Forge-Hand" Brynja** — *The Master Smith*
    *   **Role:** The legendary smith at the Guild who can craft gear from Titan parts.
    *   **Personality:** A proud, fiery, and incredibly skilled dwarf. She sees her work as a sacred art and will only craft for Slayers who have proven their worth in battle.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is the last of her clan, who were wiped out by a Titan. The forging techniques she uses are a family secret, and she has not yet found an apprentice worthy of passing them on to.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Slayer's Guildhall:** The party's home base, a massive fortress built from the bones of a long-dead Titan.
2.  **The Titan's Territory:** Each Titan's hunting ground is a unique biome that serves as the dungeon for that arc (e.g., a moving path of destruction, a storm-wreathed mountain range, an abyssal ocean trench).
3.  **The Forges:** Brynja's workshop, a place of immense heat and power, located in the heart of a dormant volcano.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a high-action epic about confronting the impossible. It captures the feeling of games like *Monster Hunter* and *Shadow of the Colossus*, where the enemy is not a person, but a force of nature. The central conflict is humanity's struggle to survive and carve out a place for itself in a world where it is not the dominant species. It is a story of courage, ingenuity, and the indomitable will to fight a mountain and win.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Titan as a Dungeon**
*   Battles against Titans are not simple combat encounters. They are multi-stage, dynamic events that treat the creature's body as a dungeon.
*   A hunt might involve:
    *   **External Phase:** A skill challenge to disable the Titan's mobility or create an opening.
    *   **Traversal Phase:** A climbing or exploration challenge to get onto the creature and reach a weak point.
    *   **Internal Phase:** A final battle inside the creature against a vital organ, all while the environment (the Titan's body) is actively trying to kill the party.
*   Titans have unique attacks that can alter the battlefield, creating a constantly evolving combat environment.

### 2. **Harvest & Craft System**
*   After defeating a Titan, the party can spend time **Harvesting** its remains. This is a skill challenge where success yields rare and powerful crafting components (e.g., *Petramach's Heartstone, Fulminox's Storm-Gland, Leviathan's Abyssal Hide*).
*   These unique components are the only materials that can be used to craft **Legendary-tier equipment**. The gear crafted from one Titan is often specifically designed to exploit the weakness of the next, creating a tangible and rewarding progression loop.
*   *Example: Armor crafted from the Petramach's shell might grant resistance to lightning, which is crucial for fighting the Fulminox.*
