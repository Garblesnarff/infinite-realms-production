## Story Arc

This short campaign is designed for a 6 to 8-session arc, with a clear escalation of stakes and challenges.

*   **Act I: The Blighted Hope (Sessions 1–3)**
    The party arrives in the ramshackle town of Oakhaven, witnessing firsthand the horrors of the Gray Rot. They are hired or compelled to find a rumored cure by a desperate local leader. Their investigation leads them through the treacherous Gloomwood and into the Sunken Scriptorium, where they discover the plague's celestial origin and the location of the Carrion Heart.

*   **Act II: The Descent (Sessions 4–6)**
    Armed with knowledge, the party must navigate the corrupted landscape to reach the crashed celestial's body, now a pulsating hive of plague-ridden monstrosities. Along the way, they will encounter factions with their own agendas for the Heart and must make difficult alliances. Inside the celestial, they must overcome both grotesque guardians and the ethical dilemma of how to use the Heart's power.

*   **Act III: The Bitter End (Sessions 7–8)**
    The climax of the campaign sees the party at the core of the Carrion Heart, where they must decide its fate. They can attempt to create a cure, which may have unforeseen consequences, destroy it to prevent its power from being misused, or even harness its dark energy for themselves. Their choice will determine the fate of Osterlyn and will be challenged by the campaign's antagonist.

## Major NPCs

*   **Elder Maeve:** (Human Cleric) The pragmatic and weary leader of Oakhaven. She is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to save her town. Her desperation can lead her to make morally grey decisions.
*   **Kaelen:** (Elf Ranger) A grizzled survivor who lost his family to the Gray Rot. He acts as a guide through the Gloomwood but secretly believes the only "cure" is a merciful death. He may betray the party if he thinks they are prolonging suffering.
*   **Valerius, the Purifier:** (Human Paladin) The charismatic and ruthless leader of the Purifiers, a militant sect that believes the Gray Rot is a divine punishment to cleanse the land of the weak. He seeks the Carrion Heart to control and unleash the plague on those he deems unworthy.
*   **"Ratchet" Anya:** (Goblin Artificer) The cunning leader of the Scrappers, a group that scavenges the blighted lands. She sees the Carrion Heart as a source of immense power and wealth and is willing to double-cross anyone to get it.
*   **The Echo:** (Aberration) A psychic remnant of the fallen celestial, manifesting as a disembodied voice or a shimmering apparition. It communicates in cryptic phrases and fragmented memories, testing the party's resolve and worthiness.

## Key Locations

*   **Oakhaven:** A small, fortified town barely surviving the plague. Its streets are muddy, its buildings are in disrepair, and the gallows are a permanent fixture in the town square.
*   **The Gloomwood:** A once-vibrant forest now choked with fungal growths and teeming with mutated creatures. The air is thick with spores, and the trees seem to whisper in the wind.
*   **The Sunken Scriptorium:** An ancient library, now partially submerged in a stagnant marsh. Its stone walls are covered in moss and esoteric carvings, and its halls are filled with the ghosts of long-dead scholars.
*   **The Weeping Plain:** A desolate, crater-scarred landscape where the celestial being fell. Strange, crystalline growths sprout from the earth, and the ground is littered with the rusted hulks of would-be scavenger vehicles.
*   **The Carrion Heart:** The colossal, decaying body of a fallen celestial. It is a living dungeon of pulsating flesh, twisting corridors of veins and arteries, and chambers filled with otherworldly flora and fauna that have adapted to the plague.

## Central Conflict

The central tension of "The Carrion Heart" is survival versus morality. The characters are constantly forced to make difficult choices with no clear "right" answer. Do they pursue a cure that may have devastating side effects? Do they align with ruthless factions to achieve their goals? The story challenges the traditional notion of heroism in a world where hope is a dwindling resource.

## Side Quests

*   **The Alchemist's Request:** A reclusive alchemist in Oakhaven asks the party to retrieve a rare, blight-resistant flower from deep within the Gloomwood. This could be a vital component for a potential cure or a potent poison.
*   **The Scrapper's Debt:** "Ratchet" Anya will offer valuable supplies or information if the party retrieves a powerful piece of celestial technology from a heavily guarded Purifier camp.
*   **The Survivor's Plea:** The party discovers a hidden enclave of survivors who are immune to the Gray Rot. They are being hunted by the Purifiers, and the party must choose to either help them escape or betray their location for a reward.
*   **A Glimmer of Hope:** The party finds the journal of one of the lost apothecaries, detailing a ritual that might purify a small area of land. Performing this ritual will attract the attention of powerful, corrupted creatures.
*   **The Whispers in the Dark:** Strange, unsettling dreams plague the party members as they get closer to the Carrion Heart. These could be messages from The Echo or attempts by a malevolent entity to corrupt them.

## Unique Mechanics

*   **Corruption Track (Hard Difficulty):** Exposure to the Gray Rot and making morally questionable decisions can earn the characters Corruption Points. These can be gained by failing saving throws against environmental hazards, being struck by corrupted creatures, or choosing a selfish or cruel course of action.
    *   **Effects:** At certain thresholds, Corruption Points can manifest as physical mutations, madness, or a loss of humanity, imposing mechanical penalties or forcing alignment shifts. This makes resting in dangerous areas a risky endeavor and emphasizes the constant threat of the plague.
*   **Gritty Realism Rest Variant (Hard Difficulty):** A short rest is 8 hours, and a long rest is one week in a safe, civilized location. This rule reinforces the tone of the campaign, making resource management critical and venturing into the wilderness a serious undertaking. Every encounter carries more weight, as the party cannot easily recover their strength.
*   **Lingering Injuries (Hard Difficulty):** When a character is critically hit or drops to 0 hit points, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they suffer a lingering injury, such as a lost eye, a broken limb, or a permanent scar, with corresponding mechanical effects. This adds a layer of consequence to combat and makes players more cautious.
