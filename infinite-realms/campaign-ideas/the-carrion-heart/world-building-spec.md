### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

---

**The Carrion Heart**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** In the blighted lands of Osterlyn, a plague known as the Gray Rot transforms its victims into ravenous, mutated beasts. The players are drawn into a desperate search for a cure, rumored to lie within the colossal, decaying husk of a fallen celestial being—the Carrion Heart. Their quest will force them to confront the grim realities of this world, the desperate factions vying for the Heart's power, and the true, horrifying nature of salvation.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Osterlyn before the celestial's fall. What was this land like?
    *   Write the story of the "Falling Star" event. What was the celestial being, and why did it fall?
    *   Describe the origin and progression of the Gray Rot plague, from initial infection to final transformation into a "Rotter."
    *   Explain the dogma of the Purifiers. Why do they believe the Gray Rot is a divine punishment?
    *   Detail the story of the first apothecary expedition and their descent into madness within the Carrion Heart.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Oakhaven Survivors** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To survive and find a cure for the Gray Rot.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the pragmatic and weary Elder Maeve.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To protect the town of Oakhaven from the Rotters.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Elder Maeve is willing to sacrifice anyone, including the players, if it guarantees a cure for her people.
        *   **Assets:** A small, fortified town; a handful of militia; deep knowledge of the local area.
        *   **Relationships:** Desperate for help; hostile to the Purifiers; wary of the Scrappers.
    *   **The Purifiers** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To control the Carrion Heart and weaponize the Gray Rot to "cleanse" the land of the weak.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A militant sect led by the charismatic and ruthless paladin, Valerius.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To bring order through faith and eradicate the plague by fire and sword.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To become the new rulers of Osterlyn, using the controlled plague as their primary weapon.
        *   **Assets:** A disciplined army of fanatics, fortified camps, a rigid belief system.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonists, viewing the players as sentimental fools and the Scrappers as vermin.
    *   **The Scrappers** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To scavenge the celestial's body for valuable technology and organic components.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A loose confederation of crews led by the cunning goblin artificer, "Ratchet" Anya.
        *   **Public Agenda:** Survival and profit.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To assemble a powerful weapon from celestial parts to secure their dominance over the other factions.
        *   **Assets:** Knowledge of the blighted lands, skill in salvaging and crafting, a fleet of ramshackle vehicles.
        *   **Relationships:** Opportunistic and neutral, willing to work with or betray anyone for a price.

**4. NPC Generation Roster**
*   **Directive:** The Character Generation Agent must create full profiles for all NPCs listed. Tier 1 NPCs are unique individuals. Tier 2 & 3 are archetypes to be instantiated multiple times with unique details as needed by the simulation.
*   **Tier 1 (Unique, Major NPCs):**
    *   **Elder Maeve:** The pragmatic and desperate leader of Oakhaven.
    *   **Valerius, the Purifier:** The charismatic, ruthless, and fanatical paladin leader of the Purifiers.

**5. Location Blueprints**
*   **Directive:** The Environment Generation Agent must create a detailed blueprint for each location below, populating all specified sub-sections.
*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Gloomwood:** A forest twisted by the Gray Rot, choked with fungal growths and mutated creatures.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Sunken Scriptorium, a grove of pulsating, fleshy fungi, the abandoned camp of the lost apothecary expedition, a river of viscous, grey fluid.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Mutated wildlife, Rotters, shambling mounds of corrupted flora.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Rare alchemical ingredients (if you can survive the side effects).
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A pack of Rotter-wolves, a cloud of infectious spores is released, the party finds a dying member of the lost expedition, a Purifier patrol is cleansing the forest with fire, the party is ambushed by Scrappers looking for celestial fragments.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The apothecaries' research is in the Sunken Scriptorium." "The Purifiers believe the heart of the forest is a holy site." "The Scrappers lost a valuable piece of tech in the deepest part of the woods."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Sickly green and grey colors, pulsating growths, thick fog), Sound (Wet, squelching noises; the snap of diseased branches; an unnatural silence), Smell (Decay, rot, damp earth, fungus).
    *   **The Carrion Heart:** The colossal, decaying body of a fallen celestial, now a living dungeon.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The Great Wound (entrance), the Pulsating Vein-Tunnels, the Chamber of Lucid Dreams (a psychic center), the Core Chamber.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** The celestial's corrupted immune system (constructs), advanced Rotters, the psychic Echo, a cult of insane survivors.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** Unique and powerful celestial components for crafting.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** The walls of a corridor constrict, a wave of digestive fluid floods a passage, the Echo shows the party a vision of the celestial's death, a group of Scrappers are trying to cut out a valuable organ, a powerful, unique Rotter attacks.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Echo is not a ghost; it's the celestial's immune system trying to communicate." "Valerius seeks the Core to become a new, plague-wielding god." "Anya wants the celestial's power source to build a weapon."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Pulsating fleshy walls, glowing veins, bizarre internal flora), Sound (A constant, low heartbeat; squelching footsteps; distant, pained psychic whispers), Smell (Blood, ozone, strange chemicals).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player gains a Blight Corruption point.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a minor physical or mental side effect (e.g., a patch of grey, numb skin; disadvantage on saves against fear; a nightmare that reveals a clue but also causes exhaustion).
    *   **IF:** The players choose to ally with the Purifiers.
    *   **THEN:** They gain military support and safe passage through Purifier territory, but they are now complicit in the Purifiers' brutal methods and will be forced to participate in morally questionable "cleansing" missions.
    *   **IF:** The players make a deal with "Ratchet" Anya and the Scrappers.
    *   **THEN:** They gain access to unique salvaged tech and a route into the Carrion Heart, but Anya will betray them as soon as they have what she wants, leaving them trapped.
    *   **IF:** The players discover the enclave of immune survivors.
    *   **THEN:** They can choose to protect them, leading to a new series of defense and escort missions, or they can report their location to Elder Maeve, who will want to dissect them to find a cure, creating a major moral dilemma.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players decide to destroy the Carrion Heart.
    *   **THEN:** The Gray Rot is halted, but the source of a potential cure is gone forever. Osterlyn is left a shattered, but slowly healing, land. Generate an epilogue where the factions must now survive in a world without a magical solution.
