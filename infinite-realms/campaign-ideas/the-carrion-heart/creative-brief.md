# Creative Brief: The Carrion Heart

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Industrial Biopunk (Blame!-inspired)

Inspired by the incredibly detailed, oppressive, and biomechanical aesthetic of Tsutomu Nihei's manga *Blame!*. This style aims to capture the bleak, visceral, and morally ambiguous tone of "The Carrion Heart," where a plague transforms life and a fallen celestial becomes a grotesque, living dungeon.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Decay and Fusion:** Describe environments and creatures as a blend of decaying industrial structures and mutated organic forms. Show how flesh and metal intertwine.
*   **Overwhelming Scale:** Convey the vastness and oppressive nature of the blighted lands and the colossal Carrion Heart.
*   **Gritty Detail:** Focus on the tactile quality of textures—rust, grime, pulsating flesh, fungal growths.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Bleak, visceral, morally ambiguous, grotesque, decaying, industrial, biomechanical, oppressive, corrupted, unsettling.
*   **Feeling:** A pervasive sense of dread and the slow, inevitable march of decay. The atmosphere should be heavy, suffocating, and filled with the unsettling sounds of a dying, transforming world. Hope is a distant memory.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Extremely detailed and intricate linework, often creating a sense of overwhelming complexity and claustrophobia. Lines are sharp and precise for industrial elements, but fluid and organic for mutated flesh and growths.
*   **Forms:** Structures are often massive, brutalist, and decaying, with organic elements (veins, sinews, fungal growths) bursting through or consuming them. Creatures are grotesque fusions of biological and mechanical components.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed digital painting in the style of Blame! The focus is on a colossal, decaying industrial structure, its metal beams twisted and fused with pulsating, fleshy growths and exposed veins."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Predominantly muted, desaturated, and dark. Dominated by deep grays, browns, blacks, and sickly greens. 
*   **Accents:** Occasional, unsettling accents of deep, bruised purples, visceral reds (for exposed organs or blood), or a faint, unnatural bioluminescent glow from corrupted elements.
*   **Lighting Influence:** Colors are heavily influenced by the dim, oppressive lighting, creating deep shadows and a sense of perpetual gloom.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a bleak and desaturated color palette of rusted browns and industrial grays, with a sickly green fungal growth spreading across the walls, and a faint, pulsating purple light from within a fleshy cavity."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Human characters are often depicted as gaunt, desperate, and heavily armored with scavenged, makeshift gear. Their faces are grim and weathered.
*   **Mutated Beasts/Rotters:** These are the primary inhabitants of the blighted lands. Their designs are grotesque fusions of animalistic forms with signs of the Gray Rot: exposed bone, fungal growths, extra limbs, and decaying flesh. They should be terrifying and pitiable.
*   **The Carrion Heart:** The celestial being itself is a monumental, decaying mass of flesh, bone, and corrupted celestial energy, with vast, pulsating internal structures.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A Rotter, a mutated human figure, its body covered in grotesque fungal growths and exposed bone, shambles through a decaying industrial landscape. Its eyes glow with a vacant, hungry light."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Blighted lands are vast, desolate, and scarred by the celestial's fall. Ramshackle towns cling to existence. The Carrion Heart itself is a living dungeon of pulsating flesh, twisting corridors of veins and arteries, and chambers filled with otherworldly flora and fauna.
*   **Atmosphere:** Heavy with spores, mist, and the pervasive smell of decay. The sky is often overcast and oppressive, or filled with the strange, dim light filtering through the celestial's body.
*   **Details:** Rusted hulks of vehicles, skeletal trees, pools of stagnant, corrupted fluids, and the constant, unsettling movement of living tissue.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of the Weeping Plain, a desolate, crater-scarred landscape under a perpetually overcast sky. In the distance, the colossal, decaying form of the Carrion Heart looms, its surface covered in strange, pulsating growths."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dim, oppressive, and often uses strong contrasts between light and shadow. Light sources are scarce and often come from internal glows, distant fires, or the faint, sickly light filtering through the blighted atmosphere.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, inky black shadows that create a sense of claustrophobia, obscure details, and hide lurking horrors. Shadows often have a wet, glistening quality.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of dread, highlight grotesque details, and emphasize the characters' vulnerability and the pervasive corruption.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dimly lit by a faint, sickly green bioluminescence emanating from the walls, casting long, distorted shadows of the characters on the wet, fleshy ground. The lighting emphasizes the claustrophobic and grotesque atmosphere of the living dungeon."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, expansive shots to emphasize the overwhelming scale of the blighted lands and the Carrion Heart. Can also use tight, claustrophobic compositions for intense encounters within the celestial's body.
*   **Techniques:** Employ forced perspective to highlight the vastness of the decaying structures or the size of the mutated creatures. Use leading lines (e.g., veins, pipes, corridors) to guide the eye through the organic landscape. Frame characters within oppressive environments or against vast, decaying backdrops.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a small group of adventurers navigating a colossal, decaying artery within the Carrion Heart. The composition emphasizes their insignificance against the overwhelming scale of the living dungeon, with pulsating walls and strange, internal flora."

## Voice

A deep, guttural, gender-neutral voice, like the grinding of rusted metal and the tearing of sinew. The timbre is wet and rasping, with a distorted quality that suggests a profound corruption. The pacing is slow and labored, each word a struggle, as if the very air is thick with decay. The emotion is a blend of ancient, cosmic pain and a cold, detached hunger, reflecting the grotesque transformation of the world. Audio quality is lo-fi and heavily distorted, with a pervasive wet, gurgling undertone and the faint, ambient hum of failing industrial machinery. Role: The voice of the Carrion Heart itself, or a corrupted being that speaks for its insatiable hunger.
