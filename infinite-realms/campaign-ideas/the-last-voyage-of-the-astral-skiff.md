*A Planar Adventure campaign — Medium Campaign (8–10 sessions) — Medium difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** The Last Voyage of the Astral Skiff
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Planar Adventure / Sci-Fi Fantasy / Road Trip
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **10–11**
**Tone (keywords):** adventurous, wacky, improvisational, high-fantasy, found-family
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The players inherit a small, beat-up, and barely functional astral skiff from a recently deceased (and notoriously unreliable) relative. Tucked in the cockpit is a lucrative, pre-paid contract: deliver a mysterious, sealed crate to the other side of the Outlands. Unfortunately, their relative also left behind a cosmos-spanning trail of debt. The party must make the delivery, all while being pursued by relentless creditors, repo-devils, and Githyanki pirates, and struggling to keep their inherited lemon of a ship from falling apart at the seams.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A road trip movie across the D&D multiverse.

*   **Act I — Ignition & Escape (Sessions 1–2):** The party takes possession of the skiff, the *Stardust Drifter*, just as their relative's creditors arrive. They must make a hasty escape into the Astral Sea, learning the basics of planar travel while fending off their first pursuer.
*   **Act II — The Great Wheel (Sessions 3–6):** The bulk of the campaign is an episodic journey across several planes. In each new plane (e.g., the clockwork plane of Mechanus, the roaring forges of the City of Brass, the chaotic jungles of the Beastlands), they must find a way to refuel, repair a critical ship component, and shake off their pursuers.
*   **Act III — The Spire and the Delivery (Sessions 7–10):** The party finally reaches the Outlands, the plane at the center of the Great Wheel. Their destination is a client in the city of Sigil, but the cargo is unexpectedly volatile. They must navigate the city's treacherous politics and make the delivery, only to discover the shocking truth about their cargo and their mysterious employer.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Inheritance”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Chase
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party gathers for the reading of their eccentric uncle's will and inherits the *Stardust Drifter*.
    *   As they are exploring the ship, a collection of angry debt collectors (a belligerent dwarf, a tiefling lawyer, and a hulking bugbear) arrive to claim the ship as payment.
    *   The party must figure out how to start the skiff and make a chaotic escape into the sky.
**Escalation:** A repo-agent from the Bank of Mechanus, a relentless Inevitable, arrives and begins methodically dismantling the hangar doors to get to the ship.

### Sessions 2-3 — “A Pit Stop in Pandemonium”
*   **Focus:** Problem Solving / Environmental Hazard
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The skiff's navigation system breaks, forcing them to make an emergency landing in the howling winds of Pandemonium.
    *   They must find a rare crystal to repair the system, located in a Mad Gnome's fortress.
    *   They must navigate the plane's primary hazard: the constant, deafening wind that makes verbal communication impossible and can drive people mad.
**Escalation:** The Githyanki pirate Captain G'thara and her crew, who have been tracking them, corner them in the Mad Gnome's fortress.

### Sessions 4-6 — “The Bytopian Bazaar”
*   **Focus:** Social / Roleplaying
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The skiff is low on fuel (astral essence), forcing the party to stop at the Infinite Bazaar, a sprawling market-plane on Bytopia.
    *   They have no money, so they must barter and trade, taking on a small, local job to earn the fuel they need (e.g., capturing an escaped, mischievous creature for a celestial merchant).
    *   They meet other planar travelers who offer them rumors, maps, and side-quests.
**Escalation:** Their pursuers from Mechanus arrive, but are bound by Bytopia's laws. They cannot use violence, so they try to entangle the party in unbreakable legal contracts to repossess the ship.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Ghost of Uncle Jebediah** — *The Annoying Guide*
    *   **Role:** The ghost of the ship's previous owner, magically bound to the skiff's helm.
    *   **Personality:** A charming, fast-talking rogue in life, and a profoundly unhelpful and distracting ghost in death. He offers terrible advice, tells long, pointless stories, and flirts with any planar entity that comes aboard.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The contract for the delivery is magically tied to his soul. If the delivery fails, his soul will be forfeit to a powerful devil, a fact he is terrified of.

2.  **Valerius the Inevitable** — *The Repo-Man*
    *   **Role:** A Marut (or similar construct) sent by the Planar Bank of Mechanus to repossess the ship for non-payment.
    *   **Personality:** Utterly relentless and logical. It does not hate the party; they are simply a variable in an equation that ends with the ship in its possession. It cannot be reasoned with, only delayed or outsmarted.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Its programming has a logical loophole. It is programmed to repossess the *Stardust Drifter*. If the ship's name were to be legally changed, it would be forced to return to Mechanus to file new paperwork, giving the party a temporary reprieve.

3.  **Captain G'thara** — *The Pragmatic Pirate*
    *   **Role:** The Githyanki captain of a larger, more powerful astral ship, the *Void-Reaver*.
    *   **Personality:** A no-nonsense, pragmatic pirate. She doesn't care about the party's debt; she just sees their small, poorly-defended ship as an easy score for its parts and cargo.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is secretly a member of the Githzerai resistance, working to undermine the Githyanki empire from within. She might be convinced to help the party if they can offer her something that aids her cause.

## Key Locations

1.  **The *Stardust Drifter*:** The party's ship, a character in its own right. Cramped, unreliable, but home.
2.  **The Astral Sea:** The silvery, timeless void between planes, dotted with the floating corpses of dead gods and strange astral phenomena.
3.  **The Clockwork City of Regulus:** A city on the plane of Mechanus where all citizens are constructs and all actions are dictated by a master schedule.
4.  **Sigil, the City of Doors:** The ring-shaped city at the center of the multiverse, filled with portals to every conceivable plane.

## Central Conflict

This is a story about freedom, found family, and the consequences of the past. The central conflict is the constant, external pressure of the chase versus the internal challenge of keeping their ship and their crew together. It's a lighthearted, adventurous romp that prioritizes player ingenuity and improvisation over grim, world-ending stakes.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Skiff's Quirks**
*   The *Stardust Drifter* is a piece of junk. At the start of each session, the DM rolls on a **Quirk Table** to determine what's wrong with the ship *this* time.
*   *Examples: "The ship's magical food-replicator is malfunctioning and now only produces lukewarm, grey oatmeal." "The ship's gravity plating has reversed, causing everyone to be stuck to the ceiling." "The ship's AI has developed a crush on one of the players and refuses to listen to anyone else."
*   Dealing with the quirk, either by repairing it (a skill challenge) or creatively working around it, becomes a mini-objective for the session.

### 2. **Planar Hazards**
*   Each plane is not just a backdrop, but an active environmental challenge. The DM has a deck of **Hazard Cards** for each type of plane (e.g., Lawful, Chaotic, Fiendish).
*   When the players enter a new, dangerous region or after a set amount of time, the DM draws a card. This might introduce a sudden, unexpected challenge.
*   *Examples (in the Beastlands): "A stampede of celestial beasts appears on the horizon." "The vegetation rapidly grows, threatening to entangle the ship." "A territorial Arch-Fey declares the party to be trespassers in its domain."
