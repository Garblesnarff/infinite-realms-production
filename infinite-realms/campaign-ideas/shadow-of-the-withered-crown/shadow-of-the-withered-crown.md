- **Estimated Length**: Short Campaign (6–8 sessions, assuming 3–4 hours per session)
- **Player Level Range**: Players start at level 3 and can reach level 7–8 by the end, with experience awarded for combat, roleplaying, and puzzle-solving to reflect gradual power growth in a harsh world.
- **Tone**: Gritty – emphasizing moral ambiguity, scarce resources, betrayal, and the psychological toll of survival in a decaying realm where heroes are flawed and victories come at a cost.

The story explores themes of sacrifice, as players decide whether to wield the crown's power or destroy it, risking the kingdom's total collapse.

## Story Arc
This short campaign is structured in three acts with clear escalation: Act 1 (Sessions 1–2) introduces the blight's immediate threats and hooks the players into the quest for the crown; Act 2 (Sessions 3–5) deepens the intrigue with faction politics, betrayals, and escalating dangers; Act 3 (Sessions 6–8) culminates in a high-stakes confrontation where moral choices determine the kingdom's fate. Pacing builds from survival-focused exploration to intense combats and revelations, allowing for player agency in alliances and resolutions. Multiple paths exist—allying with villains for short-term gains or pursuing a "pure" heroic route that demands greater sacrifices—ensuring replayability and adaptability.

## Central Conflict
The main tension revolves around a divine curse manifesting as an unending blight, pitting desperate survivors against each other in a conspiracy to control or destroy the Withered Crown—an artifact that could end the curse but invites cosmic corruption. This creates layers of conflict: immediate survival against undead hordes, political intrigue among factions, and existential moral dilemmas about wielding forbidden power, encouraging players to forge uneasy alliances or pursue solitary paths.

## Side Quests
- **The Herbalist's Gamble**: Help Nara test a blight-cure on villagers, involving gathering rare ingredients in the woods. Success grants healing boons but risks mutating NPCs, exploring themes of risky experimentation.

- **Ghosts of the Citadel**: Investigate hauntings in Blackthorn Citadel for Thrain, uncovering his ritual's role. Rewards include divine artifacts, but failure exposes party secrets, adding betrayal depth.

- **Bandit Queen's Tribute**: Escort a supply caravan for Elara, fending off rivals. This highlights faction loyalty, with options to steal the goods for personal gain or strengthen alliances.

- **Seer's Prophecy**: Decipher Mirael's visions to prevent a faction war in the encampment. Involves social puzzles; completion reveals a player's backstory tie-in, personalizing the gritty tone.

- **Undying's Relic**: Hunt Sylas's lost relic to weaken him early. A combat-heavy quest in catacombs, offering moral choice: use it for redemption or destruction, impacting the final battle.

## Unique Mechanics
To fit Dark Fantasy (genre) + Gritty (tone) + Medium (difficulty—balanced encounters with moderate risk of death, challenging puzzles requiring creativity, and survival elements like tracking rations without overwhelming micromanagement), introduce these optional rules:
- **Blight Corruption Track**: Players exposed to blighted areas or artifacts roll a DC 13 Constitution save or gain a corruption point (max 5). Points impose penalties like disadvantage on certain checks; at 3+, visions reveal lore but risk short-term madness. Cleansing requires rare rituals, encouraging resource hunts and moral trades.
- **Faction Loyalty System**: Track reputation with 3–4 groups (e.g., bandits, refugees) on a -5 to +5 scale. Actions shift scores, unlocking aids (allies in combat) or hindrances (ambushes). This adds gritty social depth without complex math.
- **Scarcity Mechanics**: Implement simple ration tracking—players start with 5 days' supplies; blight areas consume extras. Medium difficulty means failed foraging (Survival DC 12) leads to exhaustion levels, balancing survival with story focus.
