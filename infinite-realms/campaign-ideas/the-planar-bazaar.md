## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The Bazaar is a melting pot of creatures from across the multiverse. The party will face a wide variety of challenges, from haggling with a djinn over the price of a magic carpet to fighting off a squad of modron security guards.
*   **Navigation:** The Bazaar is a massive, ever-changing labyrinth. Navigating it will require a mix of skill, luck, and a willingness to ask for directions from the strange and often unhelpful locals.
*   **Consequences:** The Bazaar has its own set of rules, and breaking them can have serious consequences. The party could be thrown into the Bazaar's dungeon (a pocket dimension filled with mimics), or they could be banned from the Bazaar for life, making their quest impossible.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Bartering and Haggling**

*   In the Planar Bazaar, everything is for sale, but nothing has a fixed price. The party will need to barter and haggle for everything they want, from a simple healing potion to a legendary magic sword. This can be run as a series of contested social skill checks.

### 2. **Planar Currencies**

*   Gold is not the only currency in the Bazaar. Merchants might demand payment in anything from bottled screams to the memories of a first kiss. The party will need to be creative to acquire the strange and exotic currencies they need to buy what they want.

### 3. **The Great Game**

*   The Great Game is a series of contests and challenges that can be anything from a simple race to a complex puzzle to a battle to the death. The DM is encouraged to come up with their own bizarre and creative challenges for the party to face.
