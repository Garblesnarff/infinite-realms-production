# The Spectral Sleuths of Shadowbrook

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Paranormal Mystery / Gothic Horror / Roleplay-Heavy
- **Estimated Length**: 8-10 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-5 (as ghosts)
- **Tone**: Eerie, Melancholy, Mysterious, Humorous (darkly)

### Core Premise
The players awaken as ghosts, bound to the decaying manor of Shadowbrook, with no memory of their deaths, only a lingering sense of injustice. They are trapped in the ethereal plane, unable to directly interact with the living world, but capable of influencing objects, possessing animals, or subtly manipulating emotions. Their goal is to solve their own murders, uncover the dark secrets of Shadowbrook Manor, and find peace (or vengeance) before a malevolent entity known as the "Collector of Souls" claims them for its spectral army.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Echoes of the Past (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players awaken as confused spirits within Shadowbrook Manor. They must learn the rules of their ghostly existence, discover their unique spectral abilities, and piece together fragmented memories of their lives and deaths. They encounter other trapped spirits and the first signs of the Collector of Souls.

**Act 2: Unveiling the Living (Sessions 4-7)**
- As the players gather clues, they realize their murders are connected to the manor's dark history or its current, living inhabitants. They must subtly influence the living (new residents, investigators, descendants) to uncover evidence, manipulate events, and expose the truth, all while avoiding the Collector's growing power.

**Act 3: The Final Reckoning (Sessions 8-10)**
- The players identify their murderer and the full scope of Shadowbrook's secrets. The Collector of Souls makes its move, attempting to claim the players and other spirits. The campaign culminates in a confrontation where the players must use their spectral powers and the truths they've uncovered to bring their killer to justice, defeat the Collector, and finally find rest (or unleash their vengeance).

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Unquiet Awakening**: Players awaken as ghosts in different parts of Shadowbrook Manor. They experience their first ghostly abilities (e.g., passing through walls, minor telekinesis). They find their first clue: a bloodstain, a dropped locket, a chilling whisper.
- **Session 2: Whispers in the Walls**: The players explore the manor, piecing together fragmented memories and encountering other, less coherent spirits. They learn about the Collector of Souls, a malevolent entity that preys on lost spirits.
- **Session 3: The New Tenants**: A family of living investigators or new residents moves into Shadowbrook. The players must learn to subtly influence them to search for clues, perhaps by moving objects or creating eerie sounds.
- **Session 4-5: The Séance & The Suspects**: The living tenants hold a séance, providing an opportunity for the players to communicate more directly (though still cryptically). They identify potential suspects among the living or those connected to the manor's past.
- **Session 6-7: Possessions & Projections**: The players learn to possess animals (e.g., a cat, a raven) or even briefly influence weak-willed mortals to gather evidence outside the manor or manipulate key events.
- **Session 8: The Collector's Claim**: The Collector of Souls makes a direct attempt to claim one of the players, forcing the others to intervene and revealing its growing power.
- **Session 9-10: Justice & Rest**: The players finally uncover the full truth of their murders and the identity of their killer. They must orchestrate a final confrontation, using their spectral powers to expose the murderer to the living, defeat the Collector, and decide their own ultimate fate.

### Major NPCs

- **The Caretaker, Old Man Hemlock**: The elderly, superstitious caretaker of Shadowbrook Manor. **Role**: Unwitting Informant / Obstacle. **Personality**: Grumpy, isolated, and constantly muttering about the manor's "bad vibes." **Flaw/Secret**: He knows more about the manor's dark history than he lets on, having witnessed (or been involved in) past tragedies.
- **The Collector of Souls**: A terrifying, ancient entity that feeds on lost spirits. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Silent, relentless, and utterly devoid of empathy. It sees the players as mere sustenance. **Flaw/Secret**: It is bound by ancient rules and can only claim souls that are truly lost or consumed by despair, giving the players a fighting chance.
- **Lady Beatrice, the Weeping Bride**: A benevolent, but eternally sad, ghost who has been trapped in Shadowbrook for centuries. **Role**: Guide / Source of Lore. **Personality**: Gentle, mournful, and speaks in hushed tones. **Flaw/Secret**: She knows the true history of the manor but is too afraid to reveal it, fearing the Collector's wrath.

### Key Locations

- **Shadowbrook Manor**: A sprawling, decaying gothic mansion, each room holding secrets and echoes of the past.
- **The Whispering Graveyard**: The overgrown cemetery adjacent to the manor, where many of its former inhabitants (and victims) are buried.
- **The Ethereal Plane**: The ghostly dimension where the players exist, a shadowy reflection of the living world.
- **The Collector's Lair**: A terrifying, shifting pocket dimension where the Collector of Souls stores its spectral army.

### Central Conflict
The struggle to uncover the truth of their past and find peace in the afterlife, while battling a malevolent entity that seeks to claim their souls. It's a race against time and encroaching despair.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Ethereal Influence & Manifestation**: Players cannot directly interact with the physical world. Instead, they have a pool of "Ethereal Energy" that they spend to manifest effects (e.g., moving small objects, creating cold spots, whispering in someone's ear, briefly possessing a creature). Stronger manifestations cost more energy and are harder to achieve. Over-manifesting can draw the attention of the Collector of Souls or temporarily bind them to a specific object. This forces players to be creative and strategic with their limited influence, emphasizing their ghostly nature and the challenge of affecting the living world.
