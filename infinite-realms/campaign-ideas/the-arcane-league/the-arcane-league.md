## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** The campaign will feature a mix of Aether-Ball games, which are run as a series of skill challenges and tactical combats, and off-the-field encounters, which can range from a bar fight with a rival team to a negotiation with a potential sponsor.
*   **Teamwork:** Aether-Ball is a team sport, and success will depend on the party's ability to work together. They will need to develop strategies, coordinate their actions, and support each other both on and off the field.
*   **Consequences:** The world of professional sports is a high-stakes one. A loss can mean a drop in the rankings, a loss of a sponsorship deal, or even a career-ending injury. The party must be prepared to deal with the pressures of fame, fortune, and failure.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Aether-Ball**

*   Aether-Ball is a fast-paced, magical sport that is a mix of basketball, rugby, and wizard dueling. The DM will need to create a set of rules for the game, which could be run as a series of skill challenges, a tactical mini-game, or a full-fledged combat encounter.

### 2. **Team Chemistry**

*   The party's success will depend on their ability to work together as a team. The DM can track the team's chemistry, which can be affected by their actions both on and off the field. Good chemistry can provide bonuses in games, while bad chemistry can lead to penalties and infighting.

### 3. **Fame and Media**

*   As professional athletes, the party will be in the public eye. Their actions will be reported in the media, and they will have to deal with reporters, fans, and critics. This can be a source of both opportunities and complications.
