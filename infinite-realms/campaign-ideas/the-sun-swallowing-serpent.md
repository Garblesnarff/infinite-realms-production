- **Estimated Length**: 15-20 sessions
- **Player Level Range**: 1-10
- **Tone**: Primal, Desperate, Mythic, Savage

### Core Premise
The world is young, a savage land of megafauna, nascent gods, and primal spirits. The players are members of a nomadic tribe whose shaman has prophesied a time of endless night when the Sun-Swallowing Serpent, a creature of myth, will rise from the earth's core and consume the sun. The tribe must undertake a perilous migration across the untamed continent to the Sun-Spire, the only place where a ritual can be performed to either slay the Serpent or sever its path to the sky.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: The Long Shadow (Sessions 1-5)**
- The campaign begins with the first sign: the sun flickers for a moment, and the days grow noticeably shorter. The players must prove themselves as champions of the tribe, gathering resources, hunting massive beasts, and consulting with ancestral spirits to chart their path.

**Act 2: The Savage Migration (Sessions 6-14)**
- The tribe begins its journey. This act is a series of dangerous encounters and discoveries across a hostile landscape. They will cross tar pits that are the domain of an ancient tar-elemental, navigate the hunting grounds of intelligent, pack-hunting dinosaurs, and seek guidance from a mad oracle who lives at the heart of a petrified forest.

**Act 3: The Sun-Spire (Sessions 15-20)**
- The tribe arrives at the Sun-Spire, a colossal, naturally-formed crystal monolith. As the sky darkens and the Serpent begins its ascent, the players must climb the Spire, fighting off the Serpent's cultists and elemental heralds. The campaign culminates in a desperate ritual at the peak as the Serpent's maw closes around the sun.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1-2: The Great Hunt**: The players must lead a hunt against a Mammoth or a Tyrannosaurus to gather food and prove their worth. Introduction to the "Primal Magic" system.
- **Session 3: The Spirit Cave**: The players delve into a sacred cave to commune with their ancestors, learning the location of the Sun-Spire and the nature of the ritual.
- **Session 4-5: The First Sign**: The days shorten dramatically. The tribe is attacked by lesser earth-elementals, the first heralds of the Serpent.
- **Session 6-8: The Weeping Tar Pits**: The tribe must cross a vast tar field. They must negotiate with or defeat a territorial Tar-Elemental that sees the Serpent's rise as a threat to its domain.
- **Session 9-11: The Whispering Fang Jungle**: The hunting grounds of hyper-intelligent raptors who communicate through complex clicks and whistles. The party must either outsmart them or bargain for passage.
- **Session 12-14: The Stone Oracle**: The party seeks the Oracle of the Petrified Forest, a mad hermit who speaks in prophecies. He provides the final piece of the ritual but demands a great sacrifice.
- **Session 15-16: The Base of the Spire**: The tribe sets up camp. The players must defend the camp from the Serpent's cult, who have gathered to welcome the endless night.
- **Session 17-19: The Ascent**: A multi-stage climb up the Sun-Spire, involving skill challenges, environmental hazards, and combat against elemental guardians.
- **Session 20: The Serpent's Maw**: At the peak, as the world is plunged into twilight, the players perform the ritual. They don't fight the continent-sized serpent itself, but its powerful avatar, a being of shadow and fire, as the ritual completes.

### Major NPCs

- **Shaman Kaya**: The tribe's spiritual leader. **Role**: Guide / Mentor. **Personality**: Wise, patient, but physically frail. Her connection to the spirit world is strong, but her body is failing. **Flaw/Secret**: She has known this day was coming her entire life and is terrified that her interpretation of the prophecies is wrong.
- **Kaelen, the Hunt-Chief**: The tribe's greatest warrior and a rival to the players. **Role**: Rival / Ally. **Personality**: Proud, pragmatic, believes in strength over prophecy. He sees the migration as a fool's errand. **Flaw/Secret**: His bravado masks a deep-seated fear of failure. His father was exiled for leading a disastrous hunt, and he is desperate not to repeat that shame.
- **The Voice of the Serpent**: A disembodied, sibilant voice that speaks to the players in their dreams. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Ancient, patient, and utterly without malice. It sees the sun as a foreign object in its sky and simply wants to remove it. **Flaw/Secret**: It is a being of pure instinct and cannot comprehend concepts like morality or survival, making it impossible to reason with but also predictable.

### Key Locations

- **The Great Plains of Unmo**: A vast grassland teeming with megafauna.
- **The Petrified Forest of Whispers**: A forest where all the trees have turned to stone, and the wind carries the voices of those trapped within.
- **The Sun-Spire**: A colossal, miles-high crystal that hums with the sun's energy, warm to the touch even as the world freezes.
- **The Maw of Night**: The dream-space where the players confront the Serpent's avatar, a landscape of swirling shadow and dying stars.

### Central Conflict
This is a primal conflict of survival against a force of nature. The tribe is not trying to save the world out of heroism, but because their survival depends on the sun. It is a story of humanity's nascent attempts to control a world that is far older and more powerful than they are.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Primal Magic & The Spirit World**: Traditional spell slots are replaced or supplemented by a "Resonance" system. Players can perform actions that build Resonance with the natural world: successfully tracking a beast, weathering a storm, finding a hidden spring, etc. They can then spend this Resonance to fuel their magical abilities or to directly ask for boons from the local spirits. For example, a Druid might spend Resonance to ask the spirit of the river for safe passage, rather than casting a spell. This ties magic directly to the players' interaction with the environment and their understanding of the animistic world.
