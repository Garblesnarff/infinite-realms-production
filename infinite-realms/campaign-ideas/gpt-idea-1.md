Arc 4: Climax — final showdown against the central antagonist, resolution of main tension.

Major NPCs

Create 5–8 supporting characters tuned to the genre/tone. Template:

{Name}, {Role} — (e.g., Elyra Veyne, Outcast Oracle)

Personality: {Driven, bitter, zealous}

Motivation: {Seek redemption, power, survival}

Secret: {Knows villain’s weakness, but is corrupted by it}

Repeat for 5–8 unique NPCs, ensuring at least:

Mentor/guide

Rival or foil

Villain’s lieutenant

Comic relief (if tone allows)

Potential betrayer

Key Locations

Design 4–6 locales tailored to genre:

Fantasy: Crumbling fortress, sacred grove, mage’s tower

Dark Fantasy: Haunted crypt, war-torn village, cursed ruins

Steampunk: Clockwork city, airship docks, underground syndicate labs

Horror: Abandoned manor, fog-drenched harbor, asylum

Science Fantasy: Shattered planet colonies, ancient starship, psychic nexus

Each should tie into escalation (safe haven → contested zone → villain’s lair).

Central Conflict

Define the main tension. Examples:

War between rival factions threatening the world.

Ancient curse spreading like a plague.

Cosmic horror awakening beneath civilization.

Steampunk conspiracy that destabilizes society.

Side Quests (3–5)

Personal arcs for PCs (visions, lost family, rivals).

NPC-centered missions (aid or betray factions).

Exploration-driven (discover hidden ruins/technologies).

Moral dilemmas (save innocents vs. gain advantage).

Unique Mechanics

Custom rules fitting genre + tone + difficulty:

Horror + Hard: Sanity Track — failed Wisdom saves accumulate despair, unlocking roleplay & mechanical effects.

Steampunk + Gritty: Invention & Upkeep — players maintain weapons/gadgets with resource checks; malfunctions possible.

High Fantasy + Serious: Destiny Points — earned via roleplay, spent for miraculous outcomes tied to prophecy.

Dark Fantasy + Gritty: Corruption Meter — power gained at cost of morality, tracking eventual fall.
