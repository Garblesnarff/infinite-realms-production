Elaria, the Moon-Kissed Queen, an Archfey of immense power, has had her heart broken. The emotional cataclysm has shattered her heart into seven "Promise Shards," each one a physical manifestation of a promise made to her and then broken.

The players are drawn into the Feywild and tasked by the desperate Court of Seasons to find the shards and mend the Queen's heart before her sorrow un-makes her entire realm.

## Story Arc (Short Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A three-act arc of whimsy, tragedy, and healing.

*   **Act I — The Endless Spring (Sessions 1–3):** The party enters the Feywild to find it trapped in a state of perpetual, chaotic spring, with relentless rain and explosive floral growth. They must navigate the bizarre landscape and learn the cause of the Queen's sorrow from the fractured members of her court.
*   **Act II — The Shard Hunt (Sessions 4–8):** The party quests for the seven Promise Shards. Each shard is a dungeon or puzzle in itself, located in a place that reflects the nature of the broken promise (e.g., the promise of a song is in a silent labyrinth, the promise of a battle is in an arena of phantom warriors).
*   **Act III — The Mender of Hearts (Sessions 9–10):** With the shards collected, the party must confront the source of the Queen's heartbreak: a mortal who loved her but could not withstand the passage of time. They must then find a way to mend her heart, not by force, but by helping her find a new promise to believe in.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Weeping Bloom”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Feywild Chaos
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party is drawn into the Feywild through a thinning veil (e.g., a ring of mushrooms, a reflection in a pond).
    *   They find themselves in a forest where flowers bloom and wilt in seconds, and the rain tastes of tears.
    *   They encounter a frantic pixie who explains the Queen's heart is broken and the seasons are undone.
**Escalation:** A river of the Queen's sorrow, a literal torrent of despair, floods the path, forcing the party to seek higher ground at the Court of Seasons.

### Sessions 2-3 — “The Fractured Court”
*   **Focus:** Social / Information Gathering
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party arrives at the Court of Seasons, where the courtiers are behaving erratically.
    *   They must speak to the Summer Knight (manic and aggressive), the Autumn Lord (deep in melancholy), and the Winter Prince (frozen solid) to piece together the story of the seven broken promises.
    *   They are given the task of retrieving the shards.
**Escalation:** The first Promise Shard—the Promise of Laughter—is stolen by a rival fey who wishes to keep the Queen in sorrow.

### Sessions 4-5 — “The Labyrinth of Lost Voices”
*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Puzzle
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party seeks the "Promise of a Song," which is hidden in a labyrinth where all sound is magically dampened.
    *   They must navigate by sight and touch, avoiding sound-sensitive monsters like Gricks and Basilisks.
    *   The final puzzle requires them to recreate a melody without being able to hear it.
**Escalation:** Retrieving the shard causes a backlash of sonic energy, temporarily deafening one of the party members.

## Major NPCs

1.  **The Jester of Sorrows** — *The Sympathetic Antagonist*
    *   **Role:** A rival fey (and the Queen's former jester) who is actively trying to stop the party. He believes the Queen's sorrow is creating the most beautiful, tragic art the Feywild has ever seen.
    *   **Personality:** Melodramatic, flamboyant, and deeply empathetic, but with a twisted artistic sensibility.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He was the one who delivered the news of the mortal's death to the Queen, and he feels responsible for her heartbreak. He thinks prolonging her sorrow is a form of penance.

2.  **Sir Kaelan, the Summer Knight** — *The Queen's Champion*
    *   **Role:** The Queen's loyal champion, now driven half-mad by the chaotic seasons. He acts as a quest-giver and a source of Feywild lore.
    *   **Personality:** Boisterous and brave, but his moods swing wildly with the magical weather. One moment he is a cheerful ally, the next a raging berserker.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He was secretly in love with the Queen himself and is deeply jealous of the mortal who won her heart.

3.  **The Echo of a Mortal Man** — *The Source of Heartbreak*
    *   **Role:** A lingering spirit of the mortal man who the Queen loved. He is the key to mending her heart.
    *   **Personality:** Kind, gentle, and filled with regret. He appears as an old, faded man.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He cannot pass on to the afterlife while the Queen's sorrow holds him tethered to the world. He needs her to let him go.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Palace of Unending Twilight:** The Queen's palace, where time is frozen at the moment her heart was broken.
2.  **The Glass Desert:** A desert where the sand is made of shattered memories, created by the "Promise of a Future."
3.  **The Loom of Fate:** A massive, ancient tree where the Fates weave the stories of the multiverse. The "Promise of a Name" is tangled in its threads.
4.  **The Amphitheater of Echoes:** An arena where phantom armies clash endlessly, the site of the "Promise of a Victory."

## Central Conflict

This campaign is not about defeating a great evil, but about healing a great sorrow. It explores themes of love, loss, and the nature of promises. The central conflict is a race against the entropic nature of despair, forcing the players to act as therapists and adventurers, menders and warriors, in a world where emotions have physical, world-altering power.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Fey Bargains & Promises**
*   The rules of hospitality and promises are magically binding in the Queen's domain. NPCs will try to trick the party into making disadvantageous promises.
*   If a player makes a promise ("I promise to help you find your lost pet") and breaks it, they suffer a magical consequence (e.g., *You can no longer speak, only meow, until you fulfill the promise*).
*   Conversely, the party can use this to their advantage, forcing powerful fey to adhere to their word.

### 2. **Emotional Resonance**
*   The party's emotional state can affect the world around them. A character who is feeling particularly sad might cause it to start raining nearby. A character who is angry might cause thorns to grow on nearby plants.
*   The DM can use this to reward roleplaying. A player who gives a genuinely inspiring speech might grant the party temporary hit points as the world itself reacts to their hopefulness.
