### **Template: World-Building Specification Brief**

This document is the primary instruction set for the world-building AI pipeline. Each section provides explicit directives for specialized agents to generate the necessary assets for a complete and dynamic campaign world.

**The Court of Broken Promises**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise. The world should be whimsical, chaotic, and bittersweet, with emotions having tangible, physical effects on the environment.
*   **Content:** Elaria, the Moon-Kissed Queen, an Archfey of immense power, has had her heart broken. The cataclysm shattered her heart into seven "Promise Shards," throwing her domain into chaos. The players are drawn into the Feywild and tasked by the desperate Court of Seasons to find the shards and mend the Queen's heart before her sorrow un-makes the entire realm.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.
*   **Prompts:**
    *   Detail the history of Queen Elaria and her rule over the domain.
    *   Write the story of the mortal man the Queen loved and the circumstances of his death.
    *   Describe the seven promises that were broken, which now form the Promise Shards.
    *   Explain the nature of the Court of Seasons and the roles of its key members (Summer Knight, Autumn Lord, etc.).
    *   Detail the magical laws of the Feywild regarding promises, bargains, and hospitality.

**3. Faction Deep-Dive**
*   **Directive:** The Faction Generation Agent must create a detailed profile for each faction listed below. Each profile must contain the specified fields.
*   **Factions Roster:**
    *   **The Court of Seasons** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To restore the Queen's heart and bring balance back to the seasons.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A fractured court of powerful fey, including the Summer Knight and Autumn Lord, who are all vying for influence in the Queen's absence.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To save the realm from the Queen's sorrow.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** Each member of the court has a different idea of how to "fix" the Queen, ranging from finding her a new lover to erasing her memories, creating internal conflict.
        *   **Assets:** Control over different aspects of the Feywild, ancient magic, a host of lesser fey.
        *   **Relationships:** In conflict with the Jester of Sorrows; they are the players' primary patrons, but are unreliable and prone to infighting.
    *   **The Jester's Troupe** (Major)
        *   **Goals:** To prevent the players from healing the Queen, believing her sorrow is creating beautiful, tragic art.
        *   **Hierarchy:** Led by the Jester of Sorrows, a former court member.
        *   **Public Agenda:** To preserve the "artistic integrity" of the realm.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** The Jester feels responsible for the Queen's heartbreak and is prolonging her sorrow as a form of penance.
        *   **Assets:** A band of loyal, dramatic fey; mastery of illusion and misdirection; a deep understanding of the Queen's sorrow.
        *   **Relationships:** The primary antagonists, who see the players as uncultured philistines trying to ruin a masterpiece.
    *   **The Echoes of Mortality** (Minor)
        *   **Goals:** To find peace and pass on to the afterlife.
        *   **Hierarchy:** A loose collection of spirits of mortals who have died in the Feywild, led by the Echo of the Queen's mortal lover.
        *   **Public Agenda:** None.
        *   **Secret Agenda:** To convince the Queen to let go of her grief so they can be free.
        *   **Assets:** The ability to interact with the mortal world in limited ways, knowledge of the Queen's promises.
        *   **Relationships:** A potential, if ephemeral, ally for the players.

    *   **The Jester of Sorrows:** The melodramatic and sympathetic antagonist who seeks to preserve the Queen's beautiful sorrow.
    *   **Sir Kaelan, the Summer Knight:** The Queen's loyal but half-mad champion, whose moods shift with the chaotic weather.

*   **Location Roster:**
    *   **The Labyrinth of Lost Voices:** A dungeon created by the "Promise of a Song," where all sound is magically dampened.
        *   **Key Landmarks:** The entrance (a giant, silent mouth), the Echoing Caverns (where sounds are trapped and replay out of sync), the Silent Arena, the central chamber with the petrified song.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Sound-sensitive monsters (Basilisks, Gricks), echoes of past conversations, a lonely Gorgon who enjoys the quiet.
        *   **Available Goods & Services:** None. This is a dungeon.
        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A player's footsteps trigger a rockslide, a silent, screaming ghost appears, the party must navigate a room of shrieking fungi by staying silent, a rival fey is also searching the labyrinth, the party finds a page from the mortal lover's diary.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The monster at the center can only be defeated by a specific melody." "The Jester of Sorrows has laid a trap here." "The walls of the labyrinth are made of the Queen's unshed tears."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Dull, grey stone; vibrating air; strange, silent creatures), Sound (A profound, oppressive silence; the party's own heartbeats; the faint, imagined echo of a song), Smell (Dust, damp stone, fear).
    *   **The Glass Desert:** A vast desert where the sand is made of shattered memories, created by the "Promise of a Future."
        *   **Key landmarks:** The Dune of Forgotten Birthdays, the Oasis of a Single Happy Memory, the Mirage of What Could Have Been, the ruins of a sand-castle built from a child's dream.
        *   **Primary Inhabitants:** Memory-draining sand elementals, glass scorpions, the ghosts of forgotten futures.

        *   **Potential Random Encounters (x5):** A sandstorm of painful memories erupts, a player sees a vision of a future they will now never have, the party finds a single, perfect, happy memory in the form of a glass orb, a rival fey tries to steal a memory from a player, the ground shatters underfoot.
        *   **Embedded Plot Hooks & Rumors (x3):** "The Promise Shard is at the heart of the most painful memory in the desert." "You can piece together broken memories to learn a secret." "The Jester of Sorrows comes here to gather inspiration."
        *   **Sensory Details:** Sight (Shimmering glass sand, heat haze, mirages of impossible futures), Sound (The tinkle of glass, the wind, the whisper of forgotten names), Smell (Hot air, glass, nothing).

**6. Causality Chains & Dynamic World States**
*   **Directive:** The World Simulation Agent must implement the following trigger-based state changes. For each "IF" condition, the agent must pre-generate the narrative and environmental consequences for the "THEN" outcome.
*   **Triggers:**
    *   **IF:** A player breaks a promise made to a fey creature.
    *   **THEN:** Generate a whimsical but mechanically inconvenient curse for that player (e.g., they can only speak in rhymes, their shadow runs away, they attract non-hostile but annoying sprites).
    *   **IF:** The party's collective emotional state is strongly hopeful or happy.
    *   **THEN:** The immediate environment reflects this. Generate a temporary, positive magical effect (e.g., the rain of tears turns into a shower of flower petals, granting temporary HP; a path of glowing flowers illuminates the way).
    *   **IF:** The players retrieve a Promise Shard.
    *   **THEN:** The chaotic season in that region stabilizes slightly. Generate a short scene where the Queen's presence is felt as a moment of peace or clarity, and the corresponding member of the Court of Seasons becomes more lucid and helpful.
    *   **IF:** The players choose to side with the Jester of Sorrows and agree that the Queen's sorrow is beautiful.
    *   **THEN:** The Jester becomes a powerful ally, granting them boons related to illusion and performance. However, the Court of Seasons becomes hostile, and the realm decays further, making all environmental hazards more dangerous.
    *   **IF:** In the finale, the players help the Queen find a new promise to believe in.
    *   **THEN:** Generate an epilogue where the Feywild is reborn into a new, different kind of beauty, reflecting the nature of the new promise. The players are hailed as heroes of the realm and granted a powerful fey blessing.
