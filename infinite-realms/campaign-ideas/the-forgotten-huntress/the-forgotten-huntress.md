## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Hunting Philosophy System**
*   Players track their hunting philosophy through choices that affect their relationship with monsters and other hunters.
*   Philosophy affects available abilities, NPC reactions, and potential endings.
*   The system creates meaningful consequences for embracing traditional hunting versus seeking alternative solutions.

### 2. **The Monster Codex**
*   A evolving bestiary that players build through observation and research.
*   Each monster entry reveals weaknesses, behaviors, and potential for communication or redemption.
*   The codex evolves based on player discoveries, potentially revealing that some "monsters" are misunderstood guardians.

### 3. **The Ethical Dilemma Engine**
*   A system for generating moral choices during hunts and investigations.
*   Players must balance hunting success against ethical considerations and long-term consequences.
*   The engine creates situations where killing may be the easy choice but not necessarily the right one.
