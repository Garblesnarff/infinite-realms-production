# D&D 5e Campaign: The Conspiracy of Goldport

## Campaign Overview

- **Setting**: Goldport is a major port city on the coast, a hub of trade, culture, and political power. It’s governed by a city council dominated by nobles, merchant guilds, and foreign interests. Despite its prosperity, corruption, espionage, and criminal underworld thrive just out of sight.  
- **Tone**: Political intrigue, moral ambiguity. No faction is purely good or evil. The PCs must use investigation, diplomacy, deception, and sometimes covert actions more than brute force.  
- **Central Conflict**: Multiple factions (nobles, foreign embassy, criminal guilds, honest civic forces) are maneuvering for control. A conspiracy involving corrupt nobles, foreign spies, and criminal guilds threatens Goldport’s autonomy and the safety of its citizens. The players must uncover the plot, decide who to trust, and guide (or coerce) the city toward a future — possibly forging a new power balance, or even choosing a radical path.

## Major NPCs

| NPC | Role / Faction | Personality & Motivations | Potential Secrets / Conflicts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Councilor Marissa Vanbleu** | Corrupt city councilor | Wealthy noble, prides herself on refined manners & patronage; sees power as inheritance duty. She wants to secure trade profits, but is willing to skirt laws. | She’s in league with the foreign embassy; she has a gambling debt she hid; she sponsors criminal guilds for “security services” in poorer districts. |
| **Ambassador Rafiq al‐Tahira** | Foreign ambassador (from rival trade power) | Charismatic, cultured, with a veneer of diplomacy. Sees Goldport as strategically crucial for trade routes. Wants influence more than war. | He has spies in Goldport’s dock district; he might be funding (or blackmailing) some nobles; his motives include secret intelligence about local defense. |
| **“The Gray Fist” (Lorenzo “Loza” Marchetti)** | Crime boss of dockside guilds / smuggling ring | Tough, pragmatic, coated in charm when needed. Loyal to neighborhood and family; resents nobles who ignore the dockworkers. | He may help honest citizens but also engages in extortion, kidnapping, smuggling; possibly working (wittingly or not) with the embassy or corrupt nobles. |
| **Captain Elinor Wraithguard** | Honest guard captain of the City Watch | Discipline, honor, committed to justice and rule of law. Probably from middle class, worked her way up. | She is underfunded, pressured by the council; wary of corruption; may be snapping under pressure; perhaps some of her own people are compromised. |
| **Jorin Dellas** | Investigative journalist / pamphleteer | Sharp‐witted, idealistic, driven; loves uncovering corruption; not rich, uses public opinion as power. | Has enemies; might exaggerate for dramatic effect; may have been bribed or blackmailed in past; may have personal ties with one of the factions. |
| **The Informant “Shade”** | Mysterious informant / spy | Identity hidden (gender, race, etc.), communicates via secret messages. Seems to help the PCs, but always with caveats. | Might have changing loyalties; may be working for multiple factions; possibly trying to manipulate PCs for own aims. Could even be someone close to one of the other NPCs. |

## Faction Map

| Faction | Interests / Strengths | Weaknesses | Possible PC Alignment |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Corrupt Nobles (Vanbleu & allies)** | Control taxes, wealth, council votes. | Vulnerable to scandal; rivals within. | PCs could ally with reformist nobles or pit them against each other. |
| **Foreign Embassy (al-Tahira)** | Resources, spies, outside network. | Diplomacy limits actions; risk of war. | PCs might trade info or favors, but lose sovereignty. |
| **Crime Guilds (Loza)** | Info networks, local loyalty, muscle. | No legitimacy; prone to betrayal. | PCs may ally for street support, but risk corruption. |
| **Honest Civic Forces (Wraithguard & allies)** | Law, order, moral authority. | Underfunded, infiltrated, limited reach. | Natural allies for PCs, but slow and bureaucratic. |
| **Public (Dockworkers, citizens)** | Numbers, legitimacy, rumor mill. | Easily manipulated; leaderless. | PCs can sway them via Dellas or direct actions. |
| **Shade / Informants** | Hidden knowledge, secrets. | Unreliable motives, potential betrayal. | PCs must use carefully, never fully trust. |

## Moral Complexity & Dilemmas

- Exposing nobles may collapse trade stability, hurting commoners.  
- Supporting embassy may bring prosperity but sacrifice independence.  
- Using crime guilds may secure short-term goals but leave corruption entrenched.  
- Witnesses may have their own crimes — do they still deserve protection?  
- Revealing too much truth may spark riots, violence, or foreign sanctions.

## Climax & Endings

1. **Reform Path**: Corrupt nobles ousted; democracy/meritocracy strengthened.  
2. **Foreign Influence Path**: Embassy gains control; prosperity but no independence.  
3. **Shadow Rule Path**: Guilds secretly dominate; stability with hidden corruption.  
4. **Collapse / Coup**: City falls to riots, war, or foreign occupation. PCs decide who rules in the chaos.
