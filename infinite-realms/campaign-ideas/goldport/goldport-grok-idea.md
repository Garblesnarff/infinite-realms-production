# Shadows Over Goldport: A D&D 5e Intrigue Campaign

## Campaign Overview
**Setting:** Goldport is a thriving independent city-state on the edge of a vast sea, known for its bustling docks where ships from across the world unload spices, silks, and exotic artifacts. Its independence is its greatest asset—and vulnerability—fostered by a delicate balance of merchant wealth, noble oversight, and shadowy underworld dealings. The city thrives on trade but is riddled with inequality: opulent noble districts contrast with squalid slums, and rumors of piracy, smuggling, and foreign meddling abound. The campaign is designed for 4-6 players starting at level 1, progressing to level 6 by the end. It emphasizes role-playing, skill checks (especially Charisma- and Intelligence-based), and moral decision-making over combat. Encounters should favor diplomacy, deception, investigation, and stealth; fights are rare and often avoidable or consequential (e.g., alerting factions). Assume a session length of 3-4 hours.

**Tone and Themes:** This is an intrigue-heavy urban sandbox with moral complexity. No faction is purely heroic or villainous—each offers benefits and drawbacks. Players must navigate alliances, betrayals, and tough choices that affect Goldport's fate. Success depends on gathering allies, evidence, and leverage rather than brute force. Inspirations draw from city-based adventures like *Waterdeep: Dragon Heist*, focusing on faction rivalries, modular plot progression, and player agency in a web of schemes.

**Central MacGuffin:** The "Charter of Tides," an ancient magical document hidden in the city's founding vault. It grants its bearer legal and arcane authority to reshape Goldport's governance—e.g., declaring martial law, forging alliances, or dissolving the council. Factions seek it to tip the balance of power.

**Player Hooks:** The party arrives in Goldport as adventurers seeking fortune (e.g., via a trade caravan or ship). They're drawn in by a public murder that disrupts the city.

**Experience and Progression:** Award XP for milestones like uncovering clues, forging alliances, or completing side quests (500-1,000 XP per session). Combat is minimal; use social encounters for XP (e.g., successful persuasion = 100 XP). Level up every 2-3 sessions.

**DM Tips:** 
- Track faction relationships with a simple reputation system (e.g., -10 to +10 per faction; affects aid, betrayal risks).
- Prepare NPC motivation sheets: Each has goals, secrets, and pressure points.
- Encourage player creativity in investigations—allow multiple paths to clues.
- Moral ambiguity: Present factions' positives (e.g., empire's protection from threats) and negatives (oppression). Endings vary based on choices: Independence (fragile peace), annexation (stability with tyranny), guild takeover (chaotic prosperity).

## Story Arc
1. **Mysterious Murder:** A prominent merchant is assassinated in public, leaving clues pointing to deeper foul play.
2. **Investigation Reveals Conspiracy:** Players uncover links to bribes, espionage, and a hidden vault holding the Charter of Tides.
3. **Navigate Political Factions:** The party allies, spies on, or sabotages groups while dodging betrayals.
4. **Expose Truth and Choose City's Fate:** Climax in a confrontation where players decide who controls the charter—leading to multiple endings (e.g., reform the council, hand to empire, destroy it for anarchy).

## Factions and Central Conflict
Multiple groups vie for the Charter of Tides to control Goldport's trade routes and independence. Each has morally ambiguous goals: No side is "evil," but all manipulate and betray for self-interest.

- **City Council (Nobles):** Led by corrupt insiders, they maintain the status quo for personal wealth but provide bureaucratic stability. Pros: Preserve traditions and local autonomy. Cons: Widen inequality; some secretly collude with foreigners for kickbacks.
- **Thalorian Empire (Foreign Spies):** A neighboring expansionist power seeking annexation. Pros: Offer military protection against pirates and economic integration. Cons: Impose heavy taxes and cultural erasure, stripping independence.
- **Shadow Syndicate (Criminal Guilds):** Underground network of smugglers and thieves. Pros: Empower the underclass with black-market opportunities and resist oppression. Cons: Fuel crime, addiction, and violence; prioritize profit over lives.
- **Merchants' Alliance (Neutral Reformers):** Honest traders and officials pushing for fair governance. Pros: Promote equitable trade and independence. Cons: Politically weak, often naive or compromised by infighting.

The conflict escalates as factions sabotage each other: Assassinations, forged documents, and bribes create a web of paranoia. Players can join one, play them against each other, or form a coalition.

## Major NPCs
These 6 key figures drive the plot. Each has stats (use PHB/MM equivalents, e.g., Noble for councilors) and complex motivations for role-playing depth.

1. **Lord Elias Harrington (Corrupt City Councilor):** A scheming human noble (CR 1/8, Noble stats). Charismatic but greedy, he takes bribes from the empire while posing as a patriot. Secret: He's forging a treaty to sell Goldport. Motivation: Personal power; can be redeemed if players expose his family ties to the murdered merchant.
2. **Ambassador Valeria Voss (Foreign Ambassador):** An elven diplomat from Thalor (CR 1, Spy stats with +2 Charisma). Elegant and manipulative, she uses charm and spies to undermine the city. Secret: She's a reformed exile who believes annexation saves Goldport from collapse. Motivation: Loyalty to empire, but haunted by past wars—players can sway her with evidence of corruption.
3. **Razor Jax (Crime Boss):** A half-orc enforcer (CR 2, Bandit Captain stats). Ruthless leader of the Shadow Syndicate, with a code against harming innocents. Secret: He funds orphanages from smuggling profits. Motivation: Revenge against nobles who ruined his family; open to alliances if players prove trustworthy.
4. **Captain Elara Thorne (Honest Guard Captain):** A human veteran (CR 3, Veteran stats). Leader of the city watch, frustrated by corruption. Secret: She's investigating her own ranks for guild moles. Motivation: Justice and independence; acts as an early ally but questions players if they go too far.
5. **Mira Quill (Investigative Journalist):** A gnome bard (CR 1/2, Bard stats). Runs a underground pamphlet exposing scandals. Secret: She's fed info by a double agent. Motivation: Truth at any cost; sensationalizes stories, potentially harming innocents—players must decide if she's reliable.
6. **Shadow Whisper (Mysterious Informant):** A tiefling rogue (CR 1, Spy stats, disguised). Anonymous tipster who contacts players via notes. Secret: Double agent for guilds and merchants. Motivation: Survival; betrays based on highest bidder, but has a soft spot for underdogs.

## Key Locations
These 6 areas form the sandbox. Each has maps (DM sketches: e.g., multi-room buildings), encounters, and secrets. Travel between them via streets (random events like pickpockets or spies).

1. **City Hall:** Grand marble building in the civic center. Hub for bureaucracy; players navigate red tape (Persuasion DCs 15+). Secrets: Hidden ledgers in vaults revealing bribes.
2. **Noble District:** Walled estates with gardens and guards. Site for infiltrations and galas. Secrets: Underground tunnels linking mansions for secret meetings.
3. **Undercroft (Criminal Underworld):** Sewer networks and hidden taverns beneath the city. Dimly lit, trap-filled. Secrets: Guild safehouses with black-market goods.
4. **Thalorian Embassy:** Fortified compound with magical wards (Arcana DC 18 to bypass). Diplomatic immunity complicates intrusions. Secrets: Spy quarters with coded messages.
5. **Docks District:** Crowded wharves with ships and warehouses. Bustling day/night. Secrets: Smuggler coves hiding the charter's clues.
6. **Hidden Vault Chambers:** Ancient catacombs under the city (accessed via multiple entry points). Trapped and guarded; final dungeon crawl with puzzles over fights.
