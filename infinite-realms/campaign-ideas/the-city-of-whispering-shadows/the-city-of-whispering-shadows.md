## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 12–15 sessions)

A three-act arc of investigation, conspiracy, and confronting the darkness within.

*   **Act I — The First Cut (Sessions 1–4):** The party investigates their first case of shadow-theft, learning the horrifying consequences of the crime. They must navigate the city's shadowy underworld and deal with the fact that their own shadows are becoming more agitated and independent as the case progresses.
*   **Act II — The Shadow Market (Sessions 5–9):** The investigation reveals that the stolen shadows are being sold on a black market to wealthy elites who wish to replace their own, guilt-ridden shadows with blank slates. The party must infiltrate this dangerous market, run by a mysterious figure known as the "Penumbra."
*   **Act III — The Man with No Shadow (Sessions 10–15):** The party discovers the original shadow-thief is a being from the Plane of Shadow who was stripped of his own shadow centuries ago. He is not just stealing shadows, but absorbing them, hoping to gather enough to become a new, powerful entity of pure darkness. The party must confront him in his shifting, shadowy sanctum before he can complete his transformation.

    *   **Role:** The mysterious, masked figure who runs the shadow market. They are a source of information and a potential antagonist.
    *   **Personality:** Smooth, sophisticated, and utterly amoral. They see shadows not as parts of a person, but as commodities to be traded.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Penumbra is actually a collective of several high-society individuals who share a single, powerful shadow between them. They need a constant supply of new shadows to maintain their own vitality.

    *   **Role:** A grizzled, world-weary detective on the city watch who is secretly investigating the shadow-thefts against his captain's orders.

    *   **Secret/Flaw:** His partner was one of the first victims of the shadow-thief, and his investigation is fueled by a desire for revenge.

3.  **Kael** — *The Man with No Shadow*
    *   **Role:** The primary antagonist. A being from the Plane of Shadow who was exiled and stripped of his own shadow.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, sorrowful, and filled with a bottomless emptiness. He believes he is not stealing, but merely taking what he is owed.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is terrified of the light and can only move in areas of dim light or darkness. He is also vulnerable to radiant damage, which feels to him like being set on fire.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Shadow Manipulation**
*   As the campaign progresses, the players learn to interact with and control their shadows. This can be represented by a set of unique abilities that unlock at certain levels.
*   Examples: A rogue could use their shadow to create a diversion or pick a lock from a distance. A fighter could have their shadow flank an enemy, granting advantage on an attack. A wizard could cast spells as if they were standing where their shadow is.
*   However, using these abilities can cause a character's shadow to become more independent or willful, potentially acting on its own.

### 2. **Light & Darkness Dynamics**
*   The environment's lighting is a critical tactical element. Bright light can weaken or destroy shadow creatures, but it also makes the party's own shadows small and weak, limiting their abilities.
*   Dim light and darkness empower shadow creatures and the party's shadow abilities, but also hold more danger.
*   Certain puzzles may require the manipulation of light sources to cast shadows in specific ways to reveal hidden doors or clues.
