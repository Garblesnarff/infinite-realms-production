# Creative Brief: The City of Whispering Shadows

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Gaslight Noir with Stylized Shadows (Dishonored/Limbo-inspired)

Inspired by the atmospheric, gritty urban environments of *Dishonored* and the stark, expressive silhouette art of *Limbo* and *Inside*. This style aims to capture the mysterious, shadowy, and psychological tone of "The City of Whispering Shadows," where every citizen has a sentient shadow, and a killer steals the very essence of a person's being.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Light and Shadow:** Describe scenes with dramatic contrasts between flickering gaslight and deep, pervasive shadows. Shadows should be active, almost living elements.
*   **Stylized Silhouettes:** Depict sentient shadows and shadow creatures as distinct, dynamic entities, often in stark silhouette against lighter backgrounds.
*   **Gritty Urban Detail:** Focus on the worn, rain-slicked textures of a gaslit metropolis, blending realism with a sense of pervasive gloom.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Noir, mysterious, shadowy, psychological, urban, gaslight, unsettling, atmospheric, dualistic, haunting.
*   **Feeling:** A pervasive sense of hidden secrets and lurking danger. The city itself feels like a character, with its shadows holding untold stories. The atmosphere is one of constant tension and subtle unease, where the familiar is subtly twisted.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and detailed for the urban environment and human characters, with a focus on conveying texture and atmosphere. Lines for shadows and shadow creatures are often sharp, clean, and expressive, creating strong silhouettes.
*   **Forms:** Buildings are often tall and imposing, with intricate details. Human characters are grounded. Shadows are fluid and dynamic, capable of shifting and taking on menacing forms.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in the style of Dishonored meets Limbo. The focus is on a rain-slicked alleyway, with the flickering gaslight casting long, distorted shadows of a detective and their sentient shadow, which appears as a distinct, fluid silhouette."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by dark, muted tones: deep blues, grays, browns, and blacks, reflecting the perpetual twilight and rain. Warm accents come from gaslight glows (yellows, oranges) and occasional, subtle pops of color for specific details.
*   **Shadows:** Shadows are often pure black, but can have subtle, internal glows or hints of color (e.g., a faint purple or green) to indicate their sentient nature or magical origin.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark, muted color palette of deep blues and grays, illuminated by the warm, flickering glow of a gas lamp, casting long, inky black shadows that seem to writhe with a subtle, internal purple light."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Human characters are realistically proportioned, often depicted in classic noir attire (trench coats, fedoras, elegant dresses). Their faces are often grim, weary, or suspicious.
*   **Sentient Shadows:** These are the key visual element. They are depicted as distinct, fluid, and expressive entities that mirror their human counterparts but can also act independently. They can be subtle (a slightly too-long shadow) or overt (a fully formed, expressive silhouette).
*   **Shadow Creatures:** Monstrous and menacing, composed entirely of shadow, with glowing eyes or sharp, ethereal claws.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A grizzled private investigator in a trench coat, his face partially obscured by the shadow of his fedora. His sentient shadow, a distinct, fluid silhouette with glowing red eyes, stands slightly apart from him, mirroring his pose but with a more menacing stance."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** A rain-slicked, gaslit metropolis with towering, gothic-inspired buildings and narrow, shadowy alleys. The city is a character, with its architecture and pervasive darkness reflecting the mystery.
*   **Atmosphere:** Heavy with rain, fog, and the pervasive glow of gaslights. Reflections on wet surfaces are crucial for adding visual interest and depth.
*   **Details:** Grimy brickwork, ornate iron railings, flickering streetlights, and the subtle presence of non-Euclidean scorch marks or strange, shifting patterns in the shadows.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A rain-slicked street in Nocturne at night. Towering, gothic buildings disappear into the perpetual gloom, their windows reflecting the flickering gaslights. Long, distorted shadows stretch across the wet pavement, some appearing to move independently."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic and atmospheric. Strong contrasts between flickering gaslight and deep, pervasive shadows. Light sources are often from within the scene (gas lamps, windows, distant glows), creating pools of light and vast areas of darkness.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, inky black shadows that are used as compositional elements, hiding parts of characters or environments, and creating a sense of menace and mystery. Shadows can also appear to writhe or have subtle internal glows.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of tension, highlight hidden details, and emphasize the psychological and supernatural aspects of the shadow-theft.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the warm, flickering glow of a single gas lamp, casting long, sharp shadows that stretch across the wet pavement. The shadows of the characters are distinct, fluid silhouettes, with subtle, internal glows."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, atmospheric shots to establish the city's mood, and tighter, more intimate shots to focus on character expressions or subtle shadow details. Compositions can be slightly disorienting to enhance the psychological aspect.
*   **Techniques:** Employ strong diagonals, leading lines (e.g., rain streaks, architectural elements), and framing (e.g., through a doorway or window). Silhouettes are frequently used to create iconic, mysterious imagery. Reflections on wet surfaces are crucial for adding visual complexity and a sense of duality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a detective standing in a rain-soaked alley, his back to the viewer. His sentient shadow, a distinct, fluid silhouette, stretches unnaturally long before him, leading the eye into the deep, dark alley. The composition emphasizes the mystery and the pervasive shadows."

## Voice

A sibilant, gender-neutral voice, like a chorus of dry, rustling whispers carried on a cold, damp wind. The pacing is slow and deliberate, with long, unnerving pauses and overlapping murmurs, as if secrets are being shared just beyond the edge of hearing. The emotion is a blend of detached amusement, cold curiosity, and a subtle, predatory hunger that hints at the true nature of the city's shadows. Audio quality is close-miked, with a pervasive, dry, rustling texture and a subtle, phasing echo that suggests the shifting, living shadows themselves. Role: The collective voice of the city's sentient shadows, or the disembodied whispers of the shadow-thief.
