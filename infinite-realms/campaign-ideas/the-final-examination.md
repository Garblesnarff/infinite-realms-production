The most promising students are cultivated for their magical talent, and "graduation" is a euphemism for a ritual where their life force is harvested.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A desperate escape from a predatory school.

*   **Act I — The Forbidden Wing (Sessions 1–2):** The players, struggling with the demanding curriculum, stumble upon a hidden section of the library. They find the diary of a former student that details the university's monstrous secret and the true nature of the faculty.
*   **Act II — A Conspiracy of Whispers (Sessions 3–6):** The players must maintain the facade of being diligent students while secretly planning their escape. They must attend classes to learn new skills, pass their exams (skill challenges), and try to find allies, all while avoiding the suspicion of the terrifying Headmaster and his loyal student-prefects.
*   **Act III — Commencement Night (Sessions 7–10):** The party has a plan—be it disabling the university's magical barrier, finding a hidden portal, or inciting a student rebellion. They must execute it on the night of the annual Commencement Ball, a grand event that provides the perfect cover for a desperate, frantic chase across the university grounds as the faculty drops all pretense to stop them.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “Advanced Studies”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Atmosphere
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The campaign begins with the players in a typical day at Blackwood: attending a difficult class, dealing with a rival student, and feeling the pressure of the school's high standards.
    *   While researching a paper in the library, they discover a hidden door to the Forbidden Wing.
    *   Inside, they find the diary of a student who vanished years ago, which reveals the horrifying truth.
**Escalation:** As they read the final, panicked entry, they hear the footsteps of the lich-librarian patrolling the stacks outside the hidden door.

### Sessions 2-4 — “Mid-Terms”
*   **Focus:** Investigation / Social Stealth
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The players must pretend nothing is wrong. They have to attend classes and pass their mid-term exams (represented as complex skill challenges).
    *   They begin to secretly investigate potential escape routes mentioned in the diary, such as the sealed catacombs beneath the chapel or the Headmaster's private observatory.
    *   They must try to identify potential allies among the other students, while avoiding the watchful eyes of the Head Prefect.
**Escalation:** A fellow student they tried to recruit gets caught and is summarily expelled. The party sees them being dragged away by the faculty, and their own "Suspicion" level rises.

### Sessions 5-7 — “The Headmaster’s List”
*   **Focus:** Infiltration / Heist
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party learns that the magical barrier preventing escape is controlled from the Headmaster's office.
    *   They must plan and execute a heist to break into his office during a faculty meeting to find the control schematic.
    *   Inside, they find the "Commencement List," a list of students scheduled for the harvest. Their names are on it.
**Escalation:** While in the office, the Headmaster unexpectedly returns. The party must hide and escape without being discovered.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Headmaster Volkov** — *The Predator*
    *   **Role:** The ancient, charismatic, and terrifyingly powerful vampire who founded the university.
    *   **Personality:** Erudite, charming, and speaks with the calm authority of a predator that knows it is at the top of the food chain. He sees his students as both cherished pupils and livestock.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is bound by the university's ancient charter, a magically binding document. He cannot directly harm a student unless they have broken a major rule (like entering a restricted area or cheating on an exam), forcing him to act through proxies and manipulation.

2.  **Professor Mortain** — *The Lich-Librarian*
    *   **Role:** The university's chief librarian, an ancient lich who is obsessed with the acquisition and preservation of knowledge.
    *   **Personality:** Cold, dry, and humorless. He cares only for his library and is utterly indifferent to the students' fate, except when it pertains to the proper handling of his books.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He despises Headmaster Volkov's methods, not out of morality, but because he sees the harvesting of brilliant minds as a wasteful destruction of knowledge. He can be bribed with rare, lost lore, and might be convinced to "misplace" a key or "overlook" the party's presence in a restricted area.

3.  **Elara, the Head Prefect** — *The True Believer*
    *   **Role:** A brilliant, ambitious senior student and the Headmaster's most loyal enforcer.
    *   **Personality:** A strict, rule-following academic prodigy. She genuinely believes the Headmaster is a visionary and that the university's purpose is a noble sacrifice for the advancement of magic.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** She is not destined for the harvest. She has been chosen by Volkov to become a vampire and his successor. She will do anything to protect this future, but learning the full, brutal truth of the process could shatter her loyalty.

## Key Locations

3.  **The Arboretum:** A sprawling greenhouse filled with dangerous, magical plants, used for the alchemy and potions curriculum.
4.  **The Catacombs:** The sealed, forgotten tunnels beneath the university, a potential but dangerous escape route, filled with the failed experiments of past faculty.

## Central Conflict

This is a tense, paranoid escape story set against a backdrop of dark academia. The central conflict is a battle of wits against a powerful, entrenched system where the authority figures are the monsters. The players must use their intelligence and cunning to survive, knowing that a single failed test or suspicious question could lead to their doom. It is a story about the horror of powerlessness and the fight to reclaim one's own future.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Suspicion & Dread**
*   The DM tracks two meters for the party: **Suspicion** and **Dread**, both from 0 to 10.
*   **Suspicion** rises when the party gets caught breaking rules, fails a social check with faculty, or asks too many pointed questions. As Suspicion rises, they are watched more closely, and academic challenges become harder.
*   **Dread** rises when they witness something horrific or are directly threatened. As Dread rises, they may suffer psychological penalties, like being unable to gain the benefits of a long rest.
*   The party must escape before either meter reaches 10. If Suspicion maxes out, they are captured. If Dread maxes out, their will is broken and they become compliant.

### 2. **Study & Preparation**
*   Attending classes is not just flavor; it's a core mechanic for preparation. Each "class" is a short scene where players can attempt a skill check related to the subject (e.g., Arcana for Evocation, Nature for Herbology).
*   **Success:** The player gains a **Boon**. This could be a piece of information useful for their escape plan, a single-use spell scroll, a dose of a helpful potion, or temporary advantage on a specific type of check.
*   This system forces players to balance the risk of raising Suspicion by acting strangely against the reward of gaining crucial resources for their escape.
