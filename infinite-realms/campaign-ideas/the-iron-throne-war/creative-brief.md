### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Serious, strategic, honor-focused, brutal, consequential, gritty, noble, devastating.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of inevitable tragedy and strategic necessity. The atmosphere should evoke the weight of command and the cost of ambition. The world feels both nobly medieval and brutally realistic.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Strong, deliberate lines for armor and architecture combined with fluid, dynamic lines for banners, smoke, and movement.
*   **Forms:** Realistic human proportions marked by the wear of campaign life, massive stone castles with intricate defensive designs, ranks of soldiers in authentic medieval formations.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, realistic illustration in the style of Game of Thrones meets Band of Brothers, focusing on a medieval battlefield where armored knights clash amid mud and blood, with castle spires rising in the background."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Somber earth tones of mud, steel, and stone accented by royal reds, golds, and the bright crimson of fresh blood. Weather creates dramatic shifts from overcast grays to blood-red dawns.
*   **Luminosity:** Dramatic lighting from campfires, torchlight, and dawn battle scenes that create stark contrasts and emotional depth.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a grim medieval palette of mud browns and steel grays, accented by the royal red of banners and the bright crimson of battle, illuminated by the cold light of a winter dawn."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Authentic medieval clothing and armor - chainmail, plate armor, heraldic surcoats - marked by the realistic wear of campaign life: dents, bloodstains, mud, exhausted expressions.
*   **Military Elements:** Visible signs of rank, unit affiliation, and personal heraldry that tell stories of individual soldiers and commanders.
*   **Expression:** Faces show the full range of war emotions - steely determination, quiet fear, noble resolve, exhausted resignation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A battle-worn knight in dented plate armor with a bloodstained surcoat, their face scarred and resolute beneath a dented helmet, standing before ranks of weary soldiers at dawn."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast medieval landscapes with towering castles, muddy battlefields, and smoke-filled siege camps. Interiors feature stone halls, military tents, and strategic map rooms.
*   **Atmosphere:** Always heavy with the weight of conflict - distant sounds of battle, smoke from siege fires, banners flapping in cold winds, the metallic tang of blood and steel.
*   **Details:** Military world-building - siege engines under construction, military camps with personal soldier touches, strategic maps showing troop movements, castles scarred by previous battles.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of Ironhold Fortress under siege, with massive stone walls scarred by catapult fire, siege towers looming against the battlements, soldiers manning defenses as dawn breaks over a battlefield littered with the debris of war."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting that emphasizes the brutality and nobility of medieval warfare. Light sources create realistic shadows on armor and atmospheric effects on smoke and weather.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, complex shadows that occasionally reveal hidden strategic elements or create visual metaphors for the fog of war.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes both the honor of military service and the horror of its cost, with campfires creating moments of camaraderie and dawn light revealing the devastation of battle.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the golden light of dawn breaking over a battlefield, casting long shadows from siege towers and emphasizing the brutal reality of medieval warfare."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses strategic compositions with military elements in formation and intimate close-ups for personal moments. Leading lines follow battle formations, sight lines, or political hierarchies.
*   **Techniques:** Rule of thirds placing commanders against vast battlefields, dynamic angles for combat action, symmetrical compositions for formal military ceremonies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A strategic composition showing a war council planning session, the composition using converging map lines and military banners to create a sense of inevitable conflict and strategic depth."

## Voice

Audio quality features military environmental ambience - clash of steel, distant battle cries, creaking siege engines, the solemn toll of war bells, the occasional strategic command barked across the field. Role: The voice of a military chronicler, or the kingdom's royal historian recording the war for future generations.
