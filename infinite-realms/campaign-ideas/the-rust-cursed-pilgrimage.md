A century ago, the "Rust-Curse," a magical plague, swept the world, turning living tissue to crumbling, infectious rust. The remnants of civilization huddle in isolated, fortified settlements, terrified of the "Rusted Ones" that wander the wastes. The players are a group of hardened survivors who take on a desperate job: escort a young, asymptomatic child—the first person discovered to be immune to the plague—across the treacherous, bandit-ridden wastes to a fabled sanctuary known as the "Veridian Spire," humanity's last hope for a cure.

## Story Arc (Long Campaign — 15+ sessions)

A three-act arc structured as a perilous journey.

*   **Act I — The Wastes of Old Edonia (Sessions 1–6):** The party takes on the escort mission and begins their journey. They must navigate the ruins of the old world, scavenge for fuel and supplies, and fend off the first, desperate threats: Rusted Ones and low-level bandits.
*   **Act II — The Iron Highway (Sessions 7–12):** The party reaches the Iron Highway, a major artery controlled by warring factions of heavily-armed road warriors. They must negotiate, fight, or sneak their way through numerous checkpoints and moving territories, all while protecting the child from those who would exploit her.
*   **Act III — The Veridian Spire (Sessions 13–15+):** The party arrives at the Veridian Spire, only to find it is not the sanctuary they imagined. It is a high-tech, pre-plague bunker run by a cabal of scientists who created the Rust-Curse and now see the child not as a savior, but as the key to perfecting their weapon. The party must fight their way through the bunker to secure the cure and decide the fate of the creators.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Elara** — *The Immune Child*
    *   **Role:** The MacGuffin of the campaign. A quiet, resilient 10-year-old girl who holds the key to humanity's future.
    *   **Personality:** Hopeful and curious, despite the horrors she has witnessed. She forms strong bonds with the players who protect her.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** Her immunity is not passive. Her body actively breaks down the Rust-Curse, but doing so releases bursts of wild, uncontrolled magic that can be dangerous to those around her.

2.  **The 'Road-Dog'** — *The Rival Scavenger*
    *   **Role:** A lone, grizzled scavenger with a heavily modified war-rig who is also trying to get to the Veridian Spire. He is sometimes an ally, sometimes a rival.
    *   **Personality:** Cynical, selfish, and sarcastic. He claims to only look out for himself.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is escorting his own son, who is in the early stages of the Rust-Curse. He believes the Spire holds a cure and will do anything to get there first.

3.  **Director Valerius** — *The Creator*
    *   **Role:** The primary antagonist. The cold, calculating leader of the scientists in the Veridian Spire.
    *   **Personality:** Utterly pragmatic and detached from emotion. He sees the plague as a grand experiment in population control that merely went awry.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is infected with a stabilized version of the Rust-Curse himself, which has prolonged his life but requires constant, painful treatments. He needs Elara's unique biology to perfect his own immortality.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a story of hope in a desolate world. It explores themes of found family, the cost of survival, and whether the ends justify the means. The central conflict is a desperate pilgrimage, a race against time and the worst of humanity to protect the last spark of hope in a dying world.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Rust-Curse**
*   Any creature damaged by a Rusted One or a contaminated environment must make a Constitution saving throw.
*   On a failure, they contract the Rust-Curse. Each day, they must repeat the save. After three failures, they transform into a Rusted One.
*   The curse can be kept at bay with rare, scavenged medicine, but it cannot be cured by normal magical means. This creates a constant sense of dread and a drain on resources.

### 2. **Vehicle & Caravan Management**
*   The party has a vehicle that is their mobile base. They must manage its **Fuel**, **Durability**, and **Cargo**.
*   **Fuel** is consumed by travel and is a scarce resource that must be scavenged.
*   **Durability** is lost in combat or through hazardous terrain. It can be repaired with scrap parts.
*   The vehicle can be upgraded with scavenged parts: armor plating, better engines, mounted weapons, etc. This makes the vehicle a central part of the party's progression.
