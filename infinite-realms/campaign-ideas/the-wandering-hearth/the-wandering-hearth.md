# The Wandering Hearth

- **Campaign Type / Genre**: Slice-of-Life / Management / Urban Fantasy
- **Estimated Length**: 10-12 sessions (episodic)
- **Player Level Range**: 1-5
- **Tone**: Cozy, Humorous, Charming, Unexpected

### Core Premise
The players inherit (or acquire) a magical tavern, "The Wandering Hearth," a cozy establishment that appears in a different location each week, sometimes in a bustling city square, sometimes on a remote mountain pass, or even in a pocket dimension. Their task is to manage the tavern, serving a diverse clientele of adventurers, monsters, and planar travelers, while dealing with magical mishaps, eccentric staff, rival establishments, and the occasional quest that walks right through their enchanted doors. The campaign focuses on the day-to-day challenges and unexpected adventures of running a magical business.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: New Management (Sessions 1-3)**
- The players take over The Wandering Hearth, learning its magical quirks and the challenges of running a business that constantly moves. They must establish a reputation, hire staff, and deal with initial magical incidents and demanding customers.

**Act 2: Hearth & Home (Sessions 4-8)**
- The tavern gains a reputation, attracting more diverse and sometimes dangerous clientele. The players uncover the mystery behind the tavern's wandering nature, perhaps a curse, a blessing, or a sentient magical artifact. They face rival taverns, supply chain issues across dimensions, and the growing attention of powerful factions interested in the Hearth's unique properties.

**Act 3: The Hearth's True Calling (Sessions 9-12)**
- The secret of The Wandering Hearth is fully revealed, and a major threat emerges – perhaps a powerful entity seeking to control its magic, or a rival who wants to steal its unique ability. The players must defend their home, master the tavern's magic, and decide its ultimate purpose: a safe haven, a hub for adventurers, or a force for good (or profit) in the multiverse.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: Grand Opening (Again)**: The players inherit/acquire The Wandering Hearth. They discover its magical ability to move. Their first challenge: setting up in a new, unexpected location and serving their first customers, dealing with a minor magical mishap (e.g., a self-filling tankard that overflows).
- **Session 2: Staffing & Supplies**: The players must hire eccentric staff (e.g., a grumpy goblin cook, a clumsy fairy bartender, a sentient broom). They also face a supply shortage due to the tavern's sudden relocation, forcing them to venture out for ingredients.
- **Session 3: The Rival Inn**: The Wandering Hearth appears next to a well-established, hostile rival inn. The players must compete for customers, perhaps through a cooking contest or a battle of bards.
- **Session 4-5: The Regulars & The Rumors**: The tavern attracts a cast of colorful regulars, some of whom bring quests or strange problems. The players start hearing rumors about the Hearth's wandering nature, hinting at its origin.
- **Session 6-7: The Planar Portal**: The tavern appears in a pocket dimension or a bustling planar hub. The players must cater to alien tastes and deal with interdimensional customs and laws. They might find a clue about the tavern's magic.
- **Session 8: The Inspection**: A representative from the local (or interplanar) Guild of Innkeepers arrives for an inspection. The players must ensure everything is up to code, despite the magical chaos.
- **Session 9-10: The Hearth's Secret**: The players uncover the full truth behind The Wandering Hearth's magic – perhaps it's a sentient entity, a powerful artifact, or a cursed family heirloom. A powerful faction (e.g., a guild of planar mages, a demon lord seeking a mobile base) makes a move to control it.
- **Session 11-12: Last Call**: A climactic defense of The Wandering Hearth against the encroaching threat. The players must use their combined skills, the tavern's magic, and their loyal customers to protect their home. The campaign ends with the tavern's fate decided and the players as legendary innkeepers.

### Major NPCs

- **Bartholomew "Barty" Brewmaster**: The previous owner's ghost, bound to the tavern. **Role**: Guide / Comic Relief. **Personality**: Grumpy, nostalgic, and constantly offering unsolicited advice. **Flaw/Secret**: He died trying to solve the tavern's wandering curse and is secretly hoping the players will succeed where he failed.
- **Flicker, the Fairy Bartender**: A tiny, mischievous fairy who serves drinks. **Role**: Staff / Source of Chaos. **Personality**: Flighty, easily distracted, and prone to magical accidents, but surprisingly good at mixing drinks. **Flaw/Secret**: She occasionally steals shiny objects from customers, leading to awkward diplomatic incidents.
- **The Guild of Planar Innkeepers**: A powerful, bureaucratic organization that seeks to regulate all magical establishments. **Role**: Recurring Obstacle / Antagonist. **Personality**: Stuffy, rule-bound, and suspicious of any magic they don't understand or control. **Flaw/Secret**: They are secretly trying to acquire The Wandering Hearth for its unique properties, believing it to be a threat to their monopoly.

### Key Locations

- **The Common Room**: The heart of The Wandering Hearth, constantly changing decor based on its location.
- **The Enchanted Cellar**: A magically expanded cellar that always has the right temperature for storage, but sometimes contains strange, forgotten items from past locations.
- **The Shifting Kitchen**: A chaotic but efficient kitchen where magical ingredients and mundane fare are prepared.
- **The Tavern's Portal**: The magical mechanism (or sentient core) that allows The Wandering Hearth to travel.

### Central Conflict
The challenge of running a magical business that defies normal rules, while dealing with eccentric customers, magical mishaps, and external threats. It's a story about building a home and a community in an unpredictable world.

### Unique Mechanics

- **The Tavern's Reputation & Menu Management**: The Wandering Hearth has a "Reputation Score" that fluctuates based on customer satisfaction, successful quests, and how well the players manage the tavern. A higher Reputation Score attracts more diverse and lucrative clientele, but also more dangerous ones. Players also manage a "Menu" system, where they can experiment with magical ingredients to create new dishes and drinks. Successful new creations can boost Reputation and provide temporary buffs to customers (e.g., a "Potion of Liquid Courage" for a temporary Charisma boost), while failed experiments can lead to negative effects (e.g., a dish that turns customers blue, a drink that causes temporary amnesia). This encourages creative problem-solving and experimentation in the kitchen.
