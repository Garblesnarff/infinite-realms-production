# Creative Brief: Objection, Your Honorificence!

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Anime/Manga with Dramatic Flair (Ace Attorney-inspired)

Inspired by the iconic, highly expressive, and dramatically stylized visuals of the *Ace Attorney* video game series. This style aims to capture the intellectual, witty, and dramatic tone of "Objection, Your Honorificence!," where legal battles are fought with words, evidence, and a touch of magical flair.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Character Expression:** Focus on exaggerated facial expressions and dynamic body language to convey emotion, surprise, and determination.
*   **Dramatic Angles:** Use low angles, close-ups, and dynamic perspectives to heighten tension and emphasize key moments.
*   **Visual Impact of Arguments:** Represent legal and magical effects with clear, stylized visual cues (e.g., glowing text, impactful lines, shattering effects).

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Intellectual, witty, dramatic, expressive, stylized, legal, magical, intense, comedic (subtly).
*   **Feeling:** A high-stakes intellectual battle where every word and piece of evidence matters. The atmosphere should be tense and engaging, with moments of comedic relief and triumphant breakthroughs. The law is a living, breathing force.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Clean, sharp lines characteristic of anime/manga. Forms are stylized and often slightly exaggerated for expressive purposes, particularly in character design. 
*   **Textures:** Smooth, clean surfaces for courtrooms and legal documents. More detailed, grittier textures for urban investigation scenes.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A digital painting in the style of Ace Attorney. The focus is on the sharp, clean lines of a lawyer's suit, with a dramatic, stylized background of a courtroom."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Vibrant and often contrasting colors. Bright, clear blues, reds, and yellows for character accents and dramatic effects. Muted, professional tones for courtrooms and offices. 
*   **Magical Effects:** Glowing, ethereal colors (e.g., bright gold for truth spells, shimmering purple for arcane law) to highlight magical elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant color palette with a sharp contrast between the lawyer's bright blue suit and the deep red of the prosecution's bench, with a golden glow emanating from a legal document."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are highly expressive, with exaggerated facial features (wide eyes, sharp smiles, dramatic frowns) and dynamic poses. Clothing is often formal (suits, robes) but can have unique, stylized elements.
*   **Judges:** Imposing and often comically stern. The stone golem judge should be massive and unyielding, with glowing eyes that convey its magical impartiality.
*   **Witnesses:** Range from nervous and shifty to arrogant and overconfident, with their expressions and body language clearly conveying their personality.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A lawyer with wide, determined eyes and a dramatic, pointing finger, shouting 'Objection!' His suit is sharp, and his expression is highly exaggerated, conveying intense conviction."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Courtrooms are grand and imposing, with a mix of classical and magical architecture. Investigation scenes are urban and detailed, but often with a stylized, almost comic-book feel.
*   **Atmosphere:** Can shift from the tense, formal atmosphere of the courtroom to the grittier, more mysterious feel of the city's underworld. 
*   **Details:** Glowing legal documents, magically sealed crime scenes, arcane symbols subtly integrated into architecture, and the occasional spectral librarian in the Aetheneum of Law.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A grand courtroom with towering pillars and glowing magical runes etched into the walls. The judge's bench is massive, and a stone golem judge with glowing eyes sits impassively."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Clean, cel-shaded lighting with sharp, defined shadows that emphasize character forms and dramatic moments. Light sources are often bright and direct, highlighting key elements.
*   **Shadows:** Used to create drama and emphasize character expressions, often casting sharp, angular shadows.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of intensity, highlight emotional reactions, and emphasize the magical nature of the legal system.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by a harsh, overhead light, casting sharp, defined shadows that emphasize the lawyer's determined expression and the dramatic angle of their arm."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic and often uses extreme close-ups, low angles, and rapid cuts (implied in still images) to create a sense of fast-paced drama. 
*   **Techniques:** Employ strong diagonals and leading lines to guide the eye. Frame characters against dramatic backgrounds or through the perspective of other characters. Use split panels or multiple frames within a single image to convey sequential action or contrasting reactions.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic, low-angle shot of a lawyer, their face in a determined close-up, with a massive 'OBJECTION!' text bubble appearing dramatically behind them. The composition emphasizes the intensity of the moment."

## Voice

A clear, sharp, and energetic young adult male voice, like a legal eagle soaring through the courtroom. His standard American accent is infused with the dramatic flair of an anime protagonist, with a varied and often rapid-fire pacing that builds to explosive pronouncements of 'Objection!' The emotion is a mix of intense conviction, witty confidence, and occasional, comically panicked squeaks. Audio quality is crisp and clear, studio-quality, with impactful sound effects for key phrases that punctuate the legal drama. Role: The passionate and determined protagonist lawyer, or the voice of the court's most flamboyant prosecutor.
