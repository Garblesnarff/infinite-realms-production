*A Legal Drama campaign — Medium Campaign (8–10 sessions) — Low-Combat difficulty*

---

## Campaign Overview

**Title:** Objection, Your Honorificence!
**Campaign Type / Genre:** Legal Drama / Urban Investigation / Social
**Estimated Length:** Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **3** → Finish **8–9**
**Tone (keywords):** intellectual, witty, low-combat, investigative, dramatic
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the city of Lex, the Law is a literal, magical force. Contracts are self-enforcing, testimony is compelled by truth spells, and a judge's verdict can alter reality itself. The players are a team of "Advocates"—part-lawyer, part-investigator—who take on an impossible case: defending a hapless imp accused of murdering a powerful merchant prince. They must navigate the city's arcane legal system, uncover a conspiracy designed to frame their client, and face a ruthless prosecution team in a trial where losing doesn't just mean jail time—it means being magically written out of existence.

## Story Arc (Medium Campaign — 8–10 sessions)

A trial that will shake the city to its foundations.

*   **Act I — The Retainer (Sessions 1–2):** The party is hired to defend Fizzle, a low-level imp who is the prime suspect in a high-profile murder. They must conduct their initial investigation, examining the magically-sealed crime scene, interviewing unreliable witnesses, and filing the correct arcane motions to get their case on the court docket.
*   **Act II — The Investigation (Sessions 3–6):** The prosecution, led by a famously ruthless Advocate, has a seemingly airtight case. The party must dig deeper, uncovering evidence of a conspiracy that points to their client being a scapegoat. This involves tracking down illicit memory-modifying wizards, consulting with ancient law-elementals, and finding loopholes in magically-binding contracts.
*   **Act III — Order in the Court (Sessions 7–10):** The trial begins. The campaign culminates in a multi-session courtroom battle. The players must present their evidence, cross-examine witnesses under a permanent "Zone of Truth," and survive the prosecution's legal and magical attacks. Their goal is not just to prove their client innocent, but to expose the real killer in dramatic, courtroom-confession fashion.

## Session-by-Session Outline

### Session 1 — “The Scapegoat”
*   **Focus:** Introduction / Investigation
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party takes the case of Fizzle, a cowardly imp found at the scene of a murder with the victim's wallet.
    *   They visit the crime scene, which is magically preserved. They must use Investigation and Perception to find clues the City Guard missed.
    *   They interview Fizzle, who gives them a confusing, terrified, and likely untrue version of events.
**Escalation:** The lead prosecutor, Advocate General Cassian, issues a magical injunction preventing the party from speaking to a key witness, forcing them to find a legal loophole.

### Sessions 2-4 — “The Paper Chase”
*   **Focus:** Research / Social
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The party must delve into the Aetheneum of Law, a magical library where books are guarded by riddles and spectral librarians.
    *   They research legal precedents to overcome Cassian's injunction.
    *   They must track down and interview a series of shady witnesses, from a gossiping gargoyle to a rival merchant, using social skills to get information.
**Escalation:** One of their key witnesses is threatened into silence. The party must find a way to legally compel their testimony or find the evidence another way.

### Sessions 5-6 — “The Smoking Wand”
*   **Focus:** Dungeon Crawl / Evidence Gathering
*   **Key Events:**
    *   The investigation reveals the murder was committed with a rare, illegal spell, leading them to an underground magic-dealer.
    *   They must infiltrate the dealer's hideout (a small, trap-filled dungeon) to find the ledger showing who purchased the spell.
    *   They find the evidence they need, but must escape as the dealer and his thugs try to destroy it.
**Escalation:** The ledger is written in a magical cipher. They must take it to a "Code-Breaker," a high-risk, high-reward underworld figure, before the court deadline.

## Major NPCs

1.  **Fizzle** — *The Client*
    *   **Role:** A fast-talking, low-level imp from the city's demonic quarter, accused of murder.
    *   **Personality:** Cowardly, sycophantic, and a pathological liar. He is clearly hiding something, but he is adamant that he is not a killer.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is not innocent of *a* crime, just *this* crime. He was at the scene to pickpocket the victim, not to kill him. He is terrified that revealing this will still get him convicted.

2.  **Advocate General Cassian** — *The Prosecutor*
    *   **Role:** The lead prosecutor for the city, a brilliant and charismatic Aasimar who has never lost a case.
    *   **Personality:** Pious, eloquent, and utterly convinced of his own righteousness. He sees the Law as a divine instrument and believes the party is defending a monster.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** He is so driven by his perfect record that he is willing to bend the rules to secure a conviction. He is not corrupt, but his pride makes him blind to evidence that contradicts his narrative.

3.  **The Justicar** — *The Judge*
    *   **Role:** An ancient, magically-animated stone golem who has presided over the High Court for centuries.
    *   **Personality:** Utterly impartial, silent, and implacable. It communicates only through magically inscribed tablets. It cannot be swayed by emotion, only by the logical presentation of certified evidence.
    *   **Secret/Flaw:** The Justicar's logic is absolute. If the party can find a genuine paradox or loophole in the city's legal code, the Justicar is magically compelled to rule in their favor, regardless of other circumstances.

## Key Locations

1.  **The Gilded Scales:** The party's dusty, underfunded law office.
2.  **The Aetheneum of Law:** A magical law library where knowledge is power and the librarians are constructs of pure law.
3.  **The Lower Wards:** The city's seedy underbelly, home to criminals, informants, and illegal magic shops.
4.  **The High Court of the Justicar:** An intimidating, cathedral-like courtroom where the final trial takes place.

## Central Conflict

This campaign is a battle of wits, where the strongest weapon is a well-supported argument. The central conflict is the search for truth in a system that is complex, rigid, and vulnerable to manipulation. It forces the players to prioritize investigation, research, and roleplaying over combat, creating a different kind of tension and a different kind of victory.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Evidence Board**
*   The party maintains an **Evidence Board**. Clues they find are added as **Evidence Cards**. Each piece of evidence has a **Weight** score (1-5) and a type (Testimony, Physical, Magical).
*   To be used in the trial, evidence must be **Certified**. This is a skill challenge that might involve finding a corroborating witness (Persuasion), proving a chain of custody (Investigation), or demonstrating its magical properties (Arcana).
*   Presenting a compelling, certified piece of evidence in court can deal "damage" to the prosecution's case.

### 2. **The Trial as Combat**
*   The final trial is a structured, multi-stage social encounter. The prosecution starts with a high **Case Strength** score.
*   The party's goal is to reduce this score to 0. They can:
    *   **Present Evidence:** A certified piece of evidence reduces the score by its Weight.
    *   **Cross-Examine Witness:** A successful Insight or Intimidation check can discredit a witness, dealing "damage" and potentially revealing new information.
    *   **Raise Objection:** A successful Intelligence (Law) check can negate a piece of the prosecution's evidence.
*   The prosecution will, in turn, attack the party's **Credibility** score. If the party's Credibility hits 0, they lose the respect of the court and the case is lost.
