# Creative Brief: The Quantum Heist

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Neo-Tokyo Cyberpunk

Inspired by the iconic, neon-drenched, and technologically advanced worlds of *Cyberpunk 2077* and *Ghost in the Shell*. This style aims to capture the high-tech, fast-paced, and thrilling atmosphere of Neo-Alexandria, a city where corporate power reigns supreme and secrets are bought and sold in the shadows.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Neon and Reflections:** Describe how neon lights illuminate and reflect on wet surfaces, chrome, and glass.
*   **Verticality and Density:** Convey the overwhelming scale of the city, with layers of buildings, sky-bridges, and flying vehicles.
*   **Gritty vs. Sleek:** Show the contrast between the polished, sterile corporate environments and the grimy, lived-in streets of the underworld.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** High-tech, neon-drenched, thrilling, stylish, cinematic, gritty, futuristic, dystopian, fast-paced.
*   **Feeling:** A world of constant stimulation and hidden dangers. A sense of urgency and high stakes. The city is a character, alive with energy but also oppressive and watchful.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and highly detailed, with a focus on sharp lines for technology and architecture, and more organic forms for characters. 
*   **Textures:** Emphasize the contrast between smooth, reflective surfaces (chrome, glass, wet pavement) and rough, worn textures (concrete, rusted metal, worn fabric).
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Cyberpunk 2077. The focus is on the sleek, chrome exterior of a flying vehicle, reflecting the neon glow of the city."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Dominated by dark, moody tones (deep blues, purples, blacks, grays) as a base, heavily accented by vibrant, glowing neon colors (electric blues, magentas, oranges, greens, yellows).
*   **Atmospheric Haze:** Colors are often diffused by rain, fog, or smog, creating a soft glow around light sources.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a dark, moody color palette of deep blues and purples, dramatically illuminated by the vibrant, glowing neon signs of a futuristic city, reflecting on the wet pavement."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Characters are often lean, athletic, and wear functional, stylish clothing that blends tactical gear with urban fashion. Cybernetic enhancements (glowing implants, prosthetic limbs) are common.
*   **Expression:** Faces are often determined, focused, or wary, reflecting the high-stakes nature of their work. Eyes often glow with subtle technological enhancements.
*   **Gear:** Weapons are sleek and futuristic, often with glowing elements. Gadgets are integrated into clothing or cybernetics.
*   **Prompt Example:** "An elite operative with glowing cybernetic implants around their eyes, wearing a sleek, dark stealth suit. They are holding a futuristic pistol with a subtle blue glow."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Dense, vertical cityscapes with towering skyscrapers, multi-layered highways, and a constant flow of flying vehicles. The city is perpetually wet from rain or condensation.
*   **Atmosphere:** Heavy with rain, fog, and the glow of neon. Reflections are key, creating a sense of depth and visual complexity.
*   **Details:** Holographic advertisements, exposed wiring, ventilation shafts, crowded street markets, and hidden, grimy alleys contrasting with pristine corporate lobbies.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of Neo-Alexandria at night. Towering skyscrapers are bathed in the glow of countless neon signs, reflecting on the rain-slicked streets below. Flying vehicles zip between buildings, leaving glowing trails."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic, high-contrast lighting, often from multiple, colored neon sources. Light is diffused by rain and atmospheric haze, creating soft glows and sharp reflections.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, dark shadows that create a sense of mystery and conceal hidden dangers. Shadows are often broken by streaks of colored light.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of energy, excitement, and danger. It defines the futuristic aesthetic and highlights key elements.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...dramatically lit by the harsh, colored glow of neon signs, casting long, distorted shadows on the wet ground. The lighting creates a sense of urgency and high-tech atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic and often uses wide, cinematic shots to capture the scale of the city, or tight, action-oriented shots for combat and stealth sequences. 
*   **Techniques:** Use leading lines (e.g., roads, building edges, light trails) to guide the eye. Frame characters against glowing cityscapes. Emphasize verticality and depth. Reflections are crucial for adding visual interest and complexity.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A dynamic, low-angle shot looking up at a character rappelling down the side of a chrome skyscraper. The building reflects the vibrant neon lights of the city, and the composition emphasizes the height and danger."

## Voice

A cool, detached female voice, smooth and synthesized, like a high-end AI or a corporate announcer delivering classified information. Her neutral, almost placeless accent is infused with the digital precision of a perfectly executed algorithm, with a measured and confident pacing that hints at the intricate dance of data and deception. The emotion is a complete lack of overt human feeling, replaced by a sense of cold efficiency and subtle, almost imperceptible, manipulation. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a subtle, digital hum and faint, ambient data bursts, emphasizing the pervasive technological influence. Role: The voice of the corporate AI overseeing Neo-Alexandria, or a hacker providing mission briefings from the shadows of the net.
