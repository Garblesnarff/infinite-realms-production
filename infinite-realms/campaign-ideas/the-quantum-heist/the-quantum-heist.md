**Tone (keywords):** high-tech, fast-paced, thrilling, stylish, cinematic
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
In the neon-drenched metropolis of Neo-Alexandria, the party is a team of elite operatives—hackers, soldiers, and spies—hired for an impossible task: to steal a quantum-entangled data core from the impenetrable vaults of the Omni-Corp corporation. This isn't just a job for money; the data core holds the key to a conspiracy that could destabilize the entire sector. The party must outsmart corporate security, rival crews, and the city's ever-watchful AI to pull off the heist of the century.

## What “Medium” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** A mix of combat, stealth, and social challenges. The party will face corporate security, rival heist crews, and automated defense systems. Success often depends on clever tactics rather than brute force.
*   **Puzzles/Security:** Bypassing security systems will involve multi-stage skill challenges, hacking mini-games, and environmental puzzles.
*   **Consequences:** Failure at any stage of the heist will raise the alarm level, bringing in stronger security forces and making the subsequent stages more difficult. A total failure might not mean a TPK, but it could lead to the party being captured or forced to flee the city.

## Central Conflict

The central conflict is a classic heist: the party versus the corporation. It's a high-stakes game of cat and mouse, where the party must use their skills, wits, and teamwork to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. The conflict is not just about stealing an object, but about uncovering a conspiracy and deciding the fate of a city.

3.  **The Rival's Secret:** The party learns that the rival crew has a secret weakness. They can exploit this weakness to sabotage their rivals' plans.

---

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **The Alarm Level**

*   **Scale:** 0 → 5. The alarm level starts at 0. Certain actions (e.g., being spotted on camera, failing a hack, triggering a sensor) will increase the alarm level.
*   **Effects:**
    *   **Level 1:** Guards are more alert.
    *   **Level 2:** Additional patrols are dispatched.
    *   **Level 3:** Elite security teams are deployed.
    *   **Level 4:** Automated defense systems (turrets, drones) are activated.
    *   **Level 5:** The building goes into full lockdown, and experimental security mechs are released.

### 2. **Hacking Mini-Game**

*   When the party's hacker attempts to bypass a system, instead of a single skill check, you can run a mini-game. This could be a puzzle, a timed challenge, or a series of contested checks against the system's AI.

### 3. **Flashbacks**

*   At key moments during the heist, you can allow players to use a "flashback" to retroactively declare that they had prepared for this specific situation. For example, if they encounter a locked door they can't bypass, a player could use a flashback to say they had acquired the keycard from a guard earlier. This encourages creative problem-solving and gives the players a safety net. Each player gets one flashback for the entire heist.
