### Core Premise
The players are newly appointed envoys or guards within the shimmering, bioluminescent city of Aquatica, a grand underwater metropolis inhabited by various aquatic races. A fragile peace between the dominant Merfolk, the industrious Kuo-Toa, and the enigmatic Abolethic cultists is maintained by the Coral Council. When a revered elder of the Merfolk is found murdered, seemingly by a Kuo-Toa assassin, the city teeters on the brink of war. The players must navigate the treacherous currents of court politics, uncover the true killer, and prevent the ancient alliances from dissolving into chaos.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Ripples of Discord (Sessions 1-3)**

**Act 2: Deep Sea Secrets (Sessions 4-8)**
- As the investigation deepens, the players uncover layers of deception, ancient grudges, and the subtle influence of the Abolethic cult, who seem to be benefiting from the rising tensions. They discover that the murder is not what it seems and that a larger plot is at play to destabilize the Coral Council.

**Act 3: The Breaking Tide (Sessions 9-12)**
- The true mastermind is revealed, and their plan to plunge Aquatica into civil war is set in motion.

### Major NPCs

- **Ambassador Coralyn**: A high-ranking Merfolk diplomat. **Role**: Initial Patron / Ally. **Personality**: Graceful, diplomatic, but fiercely loyal to her people. She believes in peace but is easily swayed by evidence. **Flaw/Secret**: She has a secret, forbidden love for a Kuo-Toa artisan, which could be used against her.
- **Chief Speaker Grok**: A gruff, pragmatic Kuo-Toa leader. **Role**: Suspect / Potential Ally. **Personality**: Suspicious of outsiders, protective of his people, speaks plainly. **Flaw/Secret**: He is secretly trying to broker a deal with a surface-dwelling pirate crew for resources, which could be seen as treason.
- **The Veiled Oracle**: An ancient, reclusive Aboleth who rarely speaks but whose pronouncements are revered. **Role**: Mysterious Informant / Antagonist. **Personality**: Alien, ancient, speaks in riddles and visions. **Flaw/Secret**: The Oracle is not truly neutral; it is subtly guiding events to its own inscrutable ends, which may or may not align with the players' goals.

### Key Locations

- **The Coral Council Chambers**: A grand hall carved from living coral, where the fate of Aquatica is decided.
- **The Bioluminescent Gardens**: Public parks filled with glowing flora and fauna, often used for clandestine meetings.
- **The Sunken Market**: A bustling marketplace where goods from across the ocean floor are traded.
- **The Abyss Gate**: A massive, ancient gate leading to the crushing depths, rumored to hold forgotten horrors and ancient power.

### Central Conflict
The central conflict is a complex web of political intrigue, racial tensions, and ancient, insidious influence. The players must uncover the truth behind a murder to prevent a war that would destroy their home.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Pressure & Perception**: The deep-sea environment affects more than just movement. Spells and abilities that rely on sound or light are altered (e.g., sound travels differently, light sources have limited range). Furthermore, the constant pressure and the subtle psychic influence of the Abolethic cult can cause "Pressure Sickness" (a new condition). Players must make Wisdom saving throws when exposed to certain areas or psychic attacks, or suffer from hallucinations, paranoia, or temporary stat reductions. This mechanic emphasizes the alien nature of the setting and the psychological toll of deep-sea living.
