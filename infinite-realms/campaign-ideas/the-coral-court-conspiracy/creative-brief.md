# Creative Brief: The Coral Court Conspiracy

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Vibrant Underwater Fantasy Realism (Aquaman-inspired)

Inspired by the visually stunning and immersive underwater worlds of the *Aquaman* films. This style aims to capture the tense, mysterious, majestic, and subtly oppressive tone of "The Coral Court Conspiracy," set in a shimmering, bioluminescent underwater metropolis where political intrigue and ancient evils lurk beneath the surface.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Luminous Beauty:** Describe vibrant, glowing underwater flora and fauna, and the shimmering quality of light filtering through water.
*   **Detail Aquatic Life:** Focus on the intricate designs of coral, kelp forests, and the unique features of various aquatic races.
*   **Subtle Menace:** Juxtapose the beauty with hints of danger, decay, or the unsettling presence of the Abolethic cult.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Tense, mysterious, majestic, oppressive, vibrant, bioluminescent, aquatic, political, ancient, shimmering.
*   **Feeling:** A world of breathtaking beauty that hides treacherous currents and ancient secrets. The atmosphere should be one of constant intrigue and subtle danger, where alliances are fragile and trust is a luxury.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Realistic and highly detailed, with a focus on conveying the fluid movement of water and aquatic life. Lines are precise for architectural elements and character features, but can be soft and flowing for kelp forests and bioluminescent effects.
*   **Forms:** Aquatic races are depicted with realistic yet fantastical anatomy. Coral structures are intricate and organic. The environment is dynamic, with currents and light playing a key role.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic digital painting in the style of Aquaman. The focus is on a majestic Merfolk diplomat, their scales shimmering with bioluminescent light, swimming through a grand hall carved from living coral."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich, vibrant, and often jewel-toned. Dominant colors include deep blues, greens, purples, and golds, reflecting the diverse aquatic life and bioluminescent flora. 
*   **Luminosity:** Many elements should have an internal glow or be bathed in ethereal light, creating a sense of wonder and mystery. The Abolethic influence might introduce murky, unsettling greens or purples.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a vibrant color palette of deep ocean blues and emerald greens, illuminated by the shimmering gold of bioluminescent coral and the ethereal purple glow of a distant Abolethic shrine."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Aquatic races are depicted with realistic proportions and intricate details, emphasizing their unique features (scales, fins, gills, bioluminescent patterns). Their attire is often flowing and elegant, made from natural underwater materials.
*   **Merfolk:** Graceful and regal, with shimmering scales and flowing fins. 
*   **Kuo-Toa:** More rugged and industrial, with rougher textures and practical gear.
*   **Abolethic Cultists:** Appear subtly corrupted, perhaps with a faint, unsettling glow in their eyes or a slight distortion in their form.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A regal Merfolk guard, their scales shimmering with bioluminescent patterns, stands watch over a grand coral archway. Their trident is adorned with intricate, glowing pearls."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Aquatica is a grand, shimmering underwater metropolis carved from living coral and bioluminescent rock. Environments include vast kelp forests, bustling markets, and ancient, sunken ruins.
*   **Atmosphere:** Filled with the gentle sway of currents, the shimmer of light, and the subtle hum of bioluminescence. The environment is both beautiful and subtly oppressive, with the crushing pressure of the deep.
*   **Details:** Intricate coral formations, schools of glowing fish, ancient ruins covered in barnacles, and the subtle presence of Abolethic symbols or unsettling psychic residue.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A panoramic view of Aquatica, a shimmering underwater metropolis. Grand halls carved from living coral glow with bioluminescent light, and schools of colorful fish swim through the intricate architecture. In the distance, a massive, ancient Abyss Gate looms ominously."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dynamic and atmospheric. Light filters through the water, creating dappled patterns and ethereal glows. Light sources are often from within the scene (bioluminescent flora, glowing crystals, distant sunbeams).
*   **Shadows:** Long, distorted shadows that emphasize the depth of the ocean and the hidden dangers. Shadows often have a fluid, shimmering quality.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting is used to create a sense of wonder, mystery, and tension. It highlights the beauty of the underwater world while hinting at the darkness beneath.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...lit by the dappled sunlight filtering through the ocean surface, casting shimmering patterns on the coral walls. The scene is illuminated by the soft, ethereal glow of bioluminescent plants, creating a mysterious and majestic atmosphere."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses wide, cinematic shots to capture the grandeur and scale of Aquatica. Can also use tight, intimate shots to focus on character expressions or subtle details of political intrigue.
*   **Techniques:** Employ leading lines (e.g., currents, coral formations) to guide the eye. Frame characters within grand architectural elements or against vast, open water. Use low angles to make imposing figures appear more majestic, or high angles to show the intricate city layout.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A wide, cinematic shot of a Merfolk diplomat and a Kuo-Toa leader standing before the Coral Council Chambers, a grand hall carved from living coral. The composition emphasizes the tension between the two figures, with the shimmering bioluminescent city in the background."

## Voice

A smooth, ethereal, and slightly echoing gender-neutral voice, like the sound of whale song carried on deep ocean currents. The pacing is slow, deliberate, and almost hypnotic, with a gentle, rhythmic cadence that suggests the ebb and flow of the tides. The emotion is a blend of ancient wisdom, a deep, underlying sadness for lost civilizations, and a subtle, almost imperceptible, hint of the immense, crushing pressure of the deep ocean. Audio quality is pristine, studio-quality, with a pervasive, low-frequency hum and a subtle, shimmering reverb that suggests vast, bioluminescent caverns and the secrets hidden beneath the waves. Role: The voice of the ocean itself, or an ancient, sentient coral reef narrating the political intrigues of Aquatica.
