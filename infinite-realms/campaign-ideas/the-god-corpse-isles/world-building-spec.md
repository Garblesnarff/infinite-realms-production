**The God-Corpse Isles: Necrotic Odyssey**

**1. Core Concept & Narrative Hook**
*   **Directive:** This is the foundational context. All generated content must align with this core premise.
*   **Content:** The world is a vast ocean dotted with islands formed from the colossal, slowly decaying corpse of a dead god. The god's flesh has become land, its bones have become mountains, and its blood has become a source of potent, corrupting magic known as "Ichor." The players are a ship's crew who, after surviving a storm, find themselves drawn into a race to the god's heart. They must get there before a death cult can perform a ritual to resurrect the dead god, an act that would not save the world, but consume it in a tidal wave of divine, necrotic flesh.

**2. Lore & History Primer**
*   **Directive:** The Lore Generation Agent must create detailed entries for each of the following prompts. These entries will form the historical and cultural bedrock of the world.

    *   Write the history of the Carrion Callers and their evolution from scholars to death cult worshippers.
    *   Describe the properties of Ichor and how it has shaped the cultures and economies of the God-Corpse Isles.
    *   Explain the various types of biological anomalies and mutations that have emerged from the god's decaying body.
