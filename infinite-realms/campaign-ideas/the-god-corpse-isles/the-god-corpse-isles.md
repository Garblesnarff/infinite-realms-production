**Campaign Type / Genre:** Exploration Nautical / Mythic Fantasy / Body Horror
**Estimated Length:** Long Campaign — 15-20 sessions
**Player Level Range:** Start **4** → Finish **13-14**
**Tone (keywords):** grotesque, wondrous, epic, nautical, decaying
**Core Premise (2–4 sentences):**
The world is a vast ocean dotted with islands formed from the colossal, slowly decaying corpse of a dead god. The god's flesh has become land, its bones have become mountains, and its blood has become a source of potent, corrupting magic known as "Ichor." The players are a ship's crew who, after surviving a storm, find themselves drawn into a race to the god's heart. They must get there before a death cult can perform a ritual to resurrect the dead god, an act that would not save the world, but consume it in a tidal wave of divine, necrotic flesh.

## Central Conflict

This campaign explores the nature of divinity, the hubris of resurrection, and the beauty of natural decay. The central conflict revolves around the Carrion Callers' plan to resurrect the dead god. The players must navigate the god-corpse world while deciding whether to prevent the resurrection at any cost or harness the god's power for good. The campaign forces difficult questions: Is it better to let a god remain dead? Can you harness divine power without corruption? And what happens when mortality confronts divinity?

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Ichor Corruption System**
*   Players track "Ichor Corruption" that accumulates through exposure to the god's blood.
*   Corruption provides powerful benefits (enhanced abilities, resistance to damage) but also drawbacks (mutations, madness, social penalties).
*   Players can spend Corruption Points for temporary power surges or save them for crucial moments.

### 2. **The Living World System**
*   The world is a decaying god-corpse, with random environmental events representing the body's final functions.
*   A sudden muscle spasm could cause earthquakes, gas buildup could lead to toxic eruptions, or nerve clusters could fire, creating lightning storms.
*   The system creates dynamic challenges that require adaptation and creative problem-solving.

### 3. **The God-Memory System**
*   Players can experience "God-Memories" - visions of the deity's final moments and thoughts.
*   These visions provide crucial lore and clues but risk psychological damage or corruption.
*   The system creates opportunities for roleplaying and reveals the god's true nature and motivations.
