# Creative Brief: The God-Corpse Isles: Necrotic Odyssey

This document outlines the core creative direction for the assets of this campaign, ensuring a consistent and fitting tone across all visuals, audio, and more.

## Art Style: Mythic Body Horror (Lovecraft meets Giger)

Inspired by the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft and the biomechanical art of H.R. Giger. This style aims to capture the grotesque beauty, divine horror, and mythic scale of the God-Corpse Isles, where divine death creates both terrifying beauty and wondrous horror in a symphony of flesh and bone.

### Core Principles for Prompts:

*   **Emphasize Divine Horror:** Focus on the terrifying beauty of divine death, showing both the horror and strange allure of god-corpse landscapes.
*   **Mythic Scale:** Highlight the incomprehensible scale of a god's corpse as a world, where islands are organs and seas are bodily fluids.
*   **Nautical Wonder:** Use composition and lighting to convey the epic scale of nautical exploration across a divine corpse.

### Detailed Style Guide for Image Generation:

**1. Overall Vibe & Mood:**
*   **Keywords:** Grotesque, wondrous, epic, nautical, decaying, divine, horrific.
*   **Feeling:** A sense of mythic horror and divine wonder. The atmosphere should evoke the terror of divine death and the beauty of cosmic decay. The world feels both incomprehensibly vast and intimately horrifying.

**2. Line Work & Form:**
*   **Style:** Organic, flowing lines for flesh and bone combined with sharp, crystalline lines for divine structures and Ichor formations.
*   **Forms:** Massive biological landscapes with intricate divine anatomy, ships navigating through vein-rivers, islands that pulse with residual life.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A highly detailed, grotesque illustration in the style of Lovecraft meets Giger, focusing on a divine corpse island where flesh mountains tower over bone cathedrals and crimson Ichor flows like rivers through the landscape."

**3. Color Palette:**
*   **Style:** Rich biological colors of crimson reds, bruised purples, and sickly greens accented by the divine gold of Ichor crystals and the pale white of exposed bone.
*   **Luminosity:** Dramatic lighting from Ichor glow, bioluminescent growths, and divine energy that creates contrast between beauty and horror.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...a divine color palette of crimson reds and bruised purples, accented by the divine gold of Ichor crystals and the pale white glow of exposed bone structures."

**4. Character Design:**
*   **Style:** Human forms showing progressive Ichor corruption - divine mutations, crystalline growths, ethereal transformations - marked by the realistic horror of divine influence.
*   **Divine Elements:** Characters that blend human appearance with divine mutations, from subtle Ichor veins to dramatic flesh-shaping abilities.
*   **Expression:** Faces show the full range of divine horror emotions - religious awe, physical pain, philosophical terror, corrupted ecstasy.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A corrupted explorer with Ichor-crystalline growths emerging from their skin, wearing weathered nautical gear, their face showing a mix of horror and divine wonder as golden Ichor pulses beneath their skin."

**5. Backgrounds & Environments:**
*   **Style:** Vast divine landscapes with god-corpse islands, Ichor seas, and bone cathedrals. Interiors feature flesh caverns, organ chambers, and divine relic vaults.
*   **Atmosphere:** Always charged with divine horror - distant sounds of flesh shifting, the hum of Ichor energy, the creak of bone structures, the weight of divine presence.
*   **Details:** Divine world-building - exposed organs functioning as geography, Ichor rivers flowing with purpose, bone spires reaching toward heaven, flesh that remembers its divine origin.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A breathtaking view of the God-Corpse Isles at divine midnight, with flesh islands floating in crimson Ichor seas, bone cathedrals piercing the storm-filled sky, ships navigating through vein-rivers toward the massive heart cavern."

**6. Shading & Lighting:**
*   **Style:** Dramatic divine lighting that emphasizes the horror and wonder of god-corpse landscapes. Light sources create realistic shadows on biological forms and atmospheric effects on Ichor phenomena.
*   **Shadows:** Deep, organic shadows that occasionally reveal hidden divine structures or create visual metaphors for lost divinity.
*   **Purpose:** Lighting emphasizes both the horror of divine death and the beauty of cosmic decay, with Ichor lighting creating wonder and biological lighting revealing horrifying details.
*   **Prompt Example:** "...divinely lit by the golden glow of Ichor crystals, casting organic shadows that pulse with residual life and emphasizing the horrifying beauty of the god-corpse landscape."

**7. Composition:**
*   **Style:** Often uses divine compositions with small ships against vast god-corpse landscapes and intimate close-ups for moments of Ichor corruption. Leading lines follow Ichor flows, bone structures, or divine anatomies.
*   **Techniques:** Rule of thirds placing explorers against massive divine backgrounds, dynamic angles for nautical action, symmetrical compositions for moments of divine revelation.
*   **Prompt Example:** "A divine composition showing a ship navigating through an Ichor sea, the composition using converging bone structures and flowing crimson rivers to create a sense of epic scale and divine horror."

## Voice

A deep, resonant voice that speaks with the weight of divine knowledge and the fragility of corrupted flesh. The narrator's standard American accent carries subtle divine echoes, with measured pacing that builds horror through careful detail and sacred pauses. The emotion is one of divine terror mixed with wondrous awe, as if chronicling the death of a god and the birth of something new. Audio quality features divine environmental ambience - distant flesh shifting, the hum of Ichor energy, the creak of bone structures, the occasional moment of divine revelation. Role: The voice of a divine scholar, or the campaign's chronicler of godly death and mortal ambition.
