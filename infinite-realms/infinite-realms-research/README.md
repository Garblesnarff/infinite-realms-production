# Infinite Realms - Strategic Research & Business Intelligence

## Project Vision
Building the "YouTube of AI-Generated Entertainment" - a multi-billion dollar ecosystem starting with solo AI D&D, expanding to campaign sharing, auto-generated publishing, 3D asset creation, and shared virtual worlds.

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- **Self-publishing**: $3.5B → $7.78B by 2032
- **Graphic novels**: $17B → $23B by 2030  
- **3D models**: $1.3-4.8B → $3-13.6B by 2033
- **3D printing**: $1.45B → $6.13B by 2033
- **TTRPG market**: ~$2B and growing

## 5-Phase Execution Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Solo AI D&D ($15-40/month subscriptions)
2. **Phase 2**: Campaign sharing + marketplace
3. **Phase 3**: Auto-generated novels/comics from campaigns  
4. **Phase 4**: 3D character models for gaming/printing
5. **Phase 5**: Shared MMORPG world
