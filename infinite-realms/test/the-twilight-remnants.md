### Core Premise
Centuries ago, the sun died, plunging the world into an eternal twilight. Civilization clings to existence around colossal "Sun-Cores" – ancient, glowing crystals or technological marvels that provide warmth, light, and a dwindling energy source. Beyond the illuminated cities lie the perpetual shadows, home to mutated creatures, forgotten horrors, and the remnants of a world that once knew daylight. The players are scavengers, guardians, or explorers from one of these twilight cities, tasked with venturing into the dangerous gloom to find new energy sources, recover lost technology, or uncover the truth behind the sun's demise before their own light fades forever.

### Story Arc

**Act 1: Fading Lights (Sessions 1-4)**
- The campaign begins in a twilight city where the local Sun-Core is dimming, threatening its survival. The players are tasked with venturing into the immediate surrounding gloom to find a new energy source, repair a failing system, or retrieve a vital component. They encounter the dangers of the perpetual night and the desperation of other survivors.

**Act 2: Echoes of the Sun (Sessions 5-10)**
- As they venture further, the players discover that the sun's death was not a natural event, but an intentional act or a catastrophic magical accident. They find ancient ruins, forgotten technologies, or cryptic messages that hint at the true history of their world and the forces that caused its eternal night. They encounter factions who either worship the darkness or seek to control the remaining light sources.

**Act 3: Rekindling the Dawn (Sessions 11-15)**
- The players locate the source of the sun's demise or a legendary artifact capable of rekindling it. They must confront the forces that seek to maintain the darkness, whether they are nihilistic cults, powerful entities that thrive in the gloom, or the lingering will of the sun's destroyer. The campaign culminates in a desperate attempt to bring back the dawn, or to secure a future for humanity in the eternal twilight.

### Session Breakdown

- **Session 1: The Dimming Core**: The players' city's Sun-Core is failing. They are sent on a desperate mission to a nearby, abandoned outpost to retrieve a vital energy cell or a schematic for repair. Introduction to the "Light & Shadow" mechanic.
- **Session 2: The Gloom's Embrace**: They venture into the perpetual twilight, encountering creatures adapted to the darkness and the psychological toll of endless night. They might find a strange, glowing artifact that hints at the sun's past.
- **Session 3: The Desperate Survivors**: They encounter a group of desperate survivors from a city whose Sun-Core has already failed. The players must decide whether to help them, leading to resource management challenges.
- **Session 4-5: The Ancient Observatory**: The players discover a ruined observatory from before the sun's death. They find fragmented records or a magical device that shows them glimpses of the sun's demise, revealing it was not natural.
- **Session 6-7: The Shadow Cult**: They encounter a cult that worships the eternal night, believing it to be a divine state. The cultists are immune to darkness and seek to extinguish all remaining Sun-Cores.
- **Session 8: The Last Seed of Light**: The players find a legendary "Seed of Light" – a dormant magical artifact that could potentially rekindle the sun, but it requires immense energy or a specific ritual.
- **Session 9-10: The Sun-Eater's Lair**: The players locate the entity or mechanism responsible for the sun's demise – perhaps a colossal shadow beast, an ancient magical weapon, or a malfunctioning celestial engine.
- **Session 11-12: The Great Blackout**: The Shadow Cult (or the Sun-Eater) makes a move to extinguish a major Sun-Core, plunging a vast region into absolute darkness. The players must race against time to prevent this.
- **Session 13-15: The Dawn's Promise**: A climactic confrontation with the forces of darkness. The players must either activate the Seed of Light, defeat the Sun-Eater, or secure a future for their people in the eternal twilight. The campaign ends with the return of the sun or the establishment of a new, resilient civilization.

### Major NPCs

- **Elder Solara**: The wise, but weary, leader of the players' city. **Role**: Quest Giver / Moral Compass. **Personality**: Resilient, pragmatic, but deeply longs for the return of the sun. **Flaw/Secret**: She carries a secret burden of guilt, believing her ancestors played a role in the sun's demise.
- **The Shadow Prophet, Malakor**: The charismatic leader of the Shadow Cult. **Role**: Antagonist. **Personality**: Serene, fanatical, and believes the eternal night is the true state of the world. **Flaw/Secret**: He is a mutated being who thrives in absolute darkness and would die if the sun returned.
- **Unit 734, the Lumina-Bot**: A small, ancient automaton from before the sun's death, designed to seek out and protect light sources. **Role**: Guide / Informant. **Personality**: Logical, speaks in archaic terms, and is single-mindedly devoted to its programming. **Flaw/Secret**: Its memory banks are corrupted, and it occasionally misinterprets its directives, leading to dangerous situations.

### Key Locations

- **The Sun-Core Cities**: Massive, illuminated bastions of civilization, powered by ancient energy sources, surrounded by perpetual gloom.
- **The Whispering Wastes**: Vast, desolate plains beyond the city lights, where mutated creatures and forgotten horrors roam.
- **The Star-Gazer's Spire**: A ruined observatory from before the sun's death, now a dangerous place where ancient knowledge is guarded by spectral entities.
- **The Heart of the Gloom**: The epicenter of the sun's demise, a place of absolute darkness and immense, ancient power.

### Central Conflict
The struggle for survival and the quest to understand the truth behind the sun's death, while battling the forces that thrive in the eternal night. It's a fight for hope and the potential return of light to a dying world.

### Unique Mechanics

- **Light & Shadow**: Light sources are a precious resource. Players have a "Light Radius" that determines their visibility and effectiveness in combat. Creatures of the gloom gain advantages in darkness, while players suffer disadvantages. Prolonged exposure to absolute darkness can inflict a new condition, "Gloom-Sickness," causing paranoia, hallucinations, and temporary stat reductions. Players must manage their light sources (torches, magical lanterns, glowing crystals) carefully, making tactical decisions about when to conserve light and when to risk venturing into the deep shadows. This mechanic emphasizes the oppressive nature of the setting and the constant struggle against the darkness.
