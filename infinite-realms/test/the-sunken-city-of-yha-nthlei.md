## What “Hard” Difficulty Means Here

*   **Encounters:** Combat will be frequent and challenging, featuring bizarre and powerful underwater creatures. The environment itself is a constant threat, with crushing pressure, freezing temperatures, and limited visibility.
*   **Survival:** The party must manage their air supply, the integrity of their submersible, and their own sanity as they delve deeper into the abyss.
*   **Consequences:** A single mistake can be fatal. A hull breach, a failed sanity save, or a wrong turn in the labyrinthine city can lead to a watery grave.

The central conflict is a struggle against a cosmic horror that is beyond mortal comprehension. The party is out of their depth in every sense of the word, and their survival depends on their ingenuity, their courage, and their ability to hold onto their sanity in the face of mind-breaking horror.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. **Sanity Score**

*   In addition to their regular ability scores, each character has a Sanity score (equal to their Wisdom score). When a character witnesses something truly horrifying or incomprehensible, they must make a Sanity saving throw (a Wisdom save). On a failure, they lose Sanity points.
*   **Effects:** As a character's Sanity score decreases, they begin to develop phobias, manias, and other forms of madness. If a character's Sanity score reaches 0, they are permanently insane.

### 2. **Submersible Management**

*   The Nautilus is a complex machine with multiple systems (e.g., life support, propulsion, sonar, weapons). The party must manage these systems, making repairs when necessary and allocating power to where it is needed most.
*   **Damage:** The submersible can take damage from sea monsters, environmental hazards, and sabotage. If a critical system is damaged, it can have dire consequences for the party.

### 3. **Limited Air Supply**

*   When the party leaves the submersible in diving suits, they have a limited supply of air. This creates a sense of urgency and claustrophobia, forcing the party to carefully plan their excursions.
