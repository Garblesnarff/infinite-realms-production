/**
 * Shared Hooks Index
 *
 * Generic React hooks that are used across multiple features.
 * Feature-specific hooks should remain in their feature directories.
 *
 * NOTE: Most hooks are currently in src/hooks/ and should eventually
 * be migrated here if they are truly generic (useDebounce, useLocalStorage, etc.)
 * or moved to their respective feature directories if feature-specific.
 */

// Placeholder for future generic hooks
// Examples of what should go here:
// - useDebounce
// - useLocalStorage
// - useAsync
// - useMediaQuery
// - useClickOutside
// - useInterval
