/**
 * tRPC Root Router
 *
 * Combines all feature-specific routers into a single root router.
 * This file is the main entry point for the tRPC API.
 *
 * To add a new router:
 * 1. Create a new router file in ./routers/
 * 2. Import it here
 * 3. Add it to the appRouter definition
 *
 * Example:
 * ```typescript
 * import { campaignRouter } from './routers/campaign.js';
 *
 * export const appRouter = router({
 *   campaign: campaignRouter,
 *   blog: blogRouter,
 * });
 * ```
