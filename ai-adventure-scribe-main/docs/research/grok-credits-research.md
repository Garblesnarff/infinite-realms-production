### Comprehensive Overview of Startup Grants and Credits Programs in 2025

In 2025, tech companies continue to support startups through credit-based grants, discounts, and free access programs, aiming to reduce barriers for early-stage innovation in areas like cloud infrastructure, AI, analytics, and collaboration tools. These offerings are typically tied to eligibility criteria focused on company age, funding stage, and affiliations with venture capital firms, accelerators, or incubators, ensuring resources go to high-potential ventures. While the user's original list covers many established programs, additional ones from companies like Vercel, Supabase, and Amplitude address gaps in frontend deployment, database management, and product experimentation. Below, we detail each program's current status, drawing from official sources to validate offerings and requirements. This includes the full set from the query plus notable additions identified through broad searches of tech ecosystem lists.

Programs often require new customer status and a valid business email/website, with applications processed in 1-7 days. Benefits are non-transferable, expire after set periods, and may incur taxes—always review terms like those at [Cloudflare's policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/terms/). For controversial aspects, such as program changes (e.g., Microsoft's shift to investor requirements), we've noted potential limitations based on available data.
