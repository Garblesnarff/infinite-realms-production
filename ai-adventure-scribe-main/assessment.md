- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **shadcn-ui:** A collection of UI components for React.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.

## Development and Deployment

The project can be developed locally by cloning the repository, installing dependencies with `npm i`, and running the development server with `npm run dev`. The README also provides instructions for deploying the project using the Lovable platform.

## Assessment
