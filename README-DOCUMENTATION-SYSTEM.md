## 🚀 How to Use Your New Documentation System

### Daily Workflow

#### 1. After Every Development Session:
```bash
# Generate X post about today's discovery
claude /x-insight "multi-agent coordination breakthrough"

# Update progress log
claude /progress-report "Memory system optimization complete"

# Use the doc-builder agent directly
claude --use-agent doc-builder "Document today's performance improvements"
```

#### 2. Weekly Content Creation:
```bash
# Create technical blog post
claude /blog-post "Phase 1: Persistent Worlds Architecture"

# Professional LinkedIn update
claude /linkedin-update "Persistent World System Complete"
```

### Automation Commands

#### Available `scripts/doc-generator.js` Commands:
```bash
# Generate daily insight
node scripts/doc-generator.js daily-insight "performance optimization"

# Update BUILD_LOG with metrics  
node scripts/doc-generator.js progress-update "Query speed improved 40x"

# Mark phase complete
node scripts/doc-generator.js phase-complete 1

# Generate metrics report
node scripts/doc-generator.js metrics

# Create blog draft
node scripts/doc-generator.js blog-draft "persistent-worlds-deep-dive"
```

## 🎯 Your X Platform Strategy

### Content Focus (Based on X Product Lead Guidance):
- **1-2 paragraphs maximum** (medium-form content)
- **Under 5 sentences** per post
- **Daily consistency** for 6 months
- **Subject matter expertise**: "AI-powered multi-agent systems for persistent RPG worlds"
- **Concrete metrics**: Always include before/after numbers

### Daily Post Types (Rotate):
- **Monday**: Multi-agent coordination discoveries
- **Tuesday**: Performance optimization wins
- **Wednesday**: World-building system insights  
- **Thursday**: Technical architecture deep-dives
- **Friday**: Feature implementation breakthroughs

### Example Posts Created for You:
Check `docs/x-posts/daily/template-examples.md` for 20+ example posts across all your 9 development phases.

## 🏗️ Documentation Requirements

### After EVERY Task:
1. ✅ Update BUILD_LOG.md with technical details
2. ✅ Document performance metrics and improvements
3. ✅ Generate X post about key discoveries
4. ✅ Commit changes with descriptive messages

### After EVERY Phase:
1. ✅ Generate comprehensive blog post
2. ✅ Create LinkedIn milestone update
3. ✅ Document lessons learned
4. ✅ Tag phase completion in git

## 📊 Performance Tracking

Your system automatically tracks:
- **Query speeds** and optimization results
- **Memory usage** and efficiency improvements
- **AI costs** per session
- **Multi-agent coordination** timings
- **Database performance** metrics

Target metrics by phase:
- **Phase 1**: World memory retrieval < 100ms
- **Phase 7**: 60fps with 10,000+ 3D objects
- **Phase 9**: < $0.05 per session

## 🤖 The doc-builder Sub-Agent

Your specialized documentation agent excels at:
- ✅ Capturing unexpected technical discoveries
- ✅ Creating engaging X posts about development
- ✅ Generating comprehensive technical blog posts
- ✅ Tracking performance metrics across phases
- ✅ Positioning you as the expert in persistent AI worlds

## 🎨 Content Templates Ready

### X Post Templates:
- Performance win template
- Discovery template  
- Multi-agent coordination template
- Phase completion template

### Blog Post Template:
- Compelling technical structure
- Before/after metrics sections
- Code examples and architecture
- Lessons learned sections
- Dev.to compatible format

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start Development**: Begin Phase 1 - Persistent Worlds
2. **Use doc-builder**: `claude --use-agent doc-builder "Starting Phase 1 implementation"`
3. **Generate First Post**: `claude /x-insight "Beginning persistent world architecture"`
4. **Track Progress**: Update BUILD_LOG.md as you work
5. **Share Daily**: Post 1-2 paragraph insights about discoveries

## 💡 Key Success Factors

### Build Authority Through:
- **Specific metrics**: "Reduced query time from 2s to 50ms"
- **Unexpected discoveries**: "Turns out NPCs need genetic memory inheritance"
- **Technical solutions**: "Solved with hierarchical memory + importance scoring"
- **Daily consistency**: 6 months of valuable insights

### Community Building:
- Share surprising challenges and clever solutions
- Include concrete numbers and performance improvements
- Position as THE expert in multi-agent persistent worlds
- Build audience of developers learning from your journey
